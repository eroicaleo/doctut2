Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths
================================

He (Stilicho) once more abandoned the provinces, recalled the troops, pressed
the new levies, which were rigorously exacted, and pusillanimously eluded; employed the
most efficacious means to arrest, or allure, the deserters; and offered the gift
of freedom, and of two pieces of gold, to all the slaves who would enlist.
By these efforts he painfully collected, from the subjects of a great empire, an
army of thirty or forty thousand men, which, in the days of Scipio or Camillus,
would have been instantly furnished by the free citizens of the territory of
Rome.

Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians
========================================================================

During a period of six hundred and nineteen years, the seat of the empire had
never been violated by the presence of a foreign enemy. The unsuccessful
expedition of Hannibal served only to display the character of the senete and
people; of a senete degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an
assembly of kings; and of a people, to whom the ambassdor of Pyrrhus ascribe the
inexhaustive resources of the Hydra.

比较这两段，就能看出罗马人的精神比起建国之初，已经堕落到了怎样的程度。
