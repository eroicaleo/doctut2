The curtain of silence shrouds tens of thousands of years of history. These long
millennia may well have witnessed wars and revolutions, ecstatic religious
movements, profound philosophical theories, incomparable masterpieces. The foragers
may have had their all-conquering Napoleans, who ruled empires half the size of
Luxembourg; gifed Beethovens who lacked symphony orchestras but brought people
to tears with the sound of their bamboo flutes; and charismatic prophets who
revealed the words of a local oak tree rather than those of a universal creator
god. But these are all mere guesses. The curtains of silence is so thick that we
cannot even be sure such things occured - let alone describe them in detail.
