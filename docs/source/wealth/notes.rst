CHAPTER IX. OF THE PROFITS OF STOCK.
====================================

这一章讲述资本的利润。斯密首先提出了考察利润的方法是看它和借贷利息的关系。斯密的理由是
这样的::

    ..., wherever a great deal can be made by the use of money, a great deal will
    commonly be given for the use of it; and that, wherever little can be made
    by it, less will commonly he given for it. Accordingly, therefore, as the
    usual market rate of interest varies in any country, we may be assured that
    the ordinary profits of stock must vary with it, must sink as it sinks, and
    rise as it rises. The progress of interest, therefore, may lead us to form
    some notion of the progress of profit.

接下来，斯密就开始举例子，做比较。
苏格兰和法国的利率比较高，都在5%左右。苏格兰因为工人工资低，所以成本低，以至于利润高。
法国利润高是斯密由经商的朋友告知的。
英格兰和荷兰比起前两国较为富裕，利率也比较低。在英格兰，存钱在银行都没有利息。在荷兰，
利息大概是2% ～ 3%。所以荷兰人就把他们的钱放在利率高的国家放贷。这一事实说明::

  ..., are circumstances which no doubt demonstrate the redundancy of their
  stock, or that it has increased beyond what they can employ with tolerable
  profit in the proper business of their own country; but they do not demonstrate
  that that business has decreased.
