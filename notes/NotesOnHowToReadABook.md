# Chapter 4 Inspectional Reading

## systematic skimming or pre-reading

1. Look at title and preface:
    * scope or aim of the book
    * special angle on his subject
    * place it in the category in your mind

2. Study the table of contents

  obtain a general sense of the book's structure. Use it as a road map. Many authors
  spend considerable amount of time in creating it.

3. Check the index if there is one.

  when you see something crucial, look up some of passages cited.

4. Read the publisher's blurb if there is one.

  Authors try to summarize as accurately as they can to the main point of the
  book.

5. Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument.

  If it has summary statement in opening and closing pages, read carefully.

6. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two,
sometimes several pages in sequence but never more than that.

  Looking for signs of the main contention and listening for the basic pulsebeat
  of the matter. Do not fail to read the last two or three pages or if there are
  an epilogue. Authors sum up what they think is new and important in these pages.

## superficial reading

In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever
stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.

Insist on understanding everything will make you miss the forest for the trees
and not reading well on any level.

## On reading speed

No single speed at which you should read.
Read quickly on simple material and slowly on difficult parts.
