# Chapter 4 Inspectional Reading

## systematic skimming or pre-reading

1. Look at title and preface:
    * scope or aim of the book
    * special angle on his subject
    * place it in the category in your mind

2. Study the table of contents

  obtain a general sense of the book's structure. Use it as a road map. Many authors
  spend considerable amount of time in creating it.

3. Check the index if there is one.

  when you see something crucial, look up some of passages cited.

4. Read the publisher's blurb if there is one.

  Authors try to summarize as accurately as they can to the main point of the
  book.

5. Look at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument.

  If it has summary statement in opening and closing pages, read carefully.

6. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two,
sometimes several pages in sequence but never more than that.

  Looking for signs of the main contention and listening for the basic pulse-beat
  of the matter. Do not fail to read the last two or three pages or if there are
  an epilogue. Authors sum up what they think is new and important in these pages.

## superficial reading

In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever
stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.

Insist on understanding everything will make you miss the forest for the trees
and not reading well on any level.

## On reading speed

No single speed at which you should read.
Read quickly on simple material and slowly on difficult parts.

# Chapter 5 How to be a demanding reader

## 4 basic questions a read asks

1. What is the book about as a whole?

  * the leading theme
  * how the author develop the theme
  * how to order and subdivide into subordinate theme

2. What is being said in detail?

  * ideas, assertions, and arguments.

3. It this book true in whole or part?

4. What of it?

  * What is its significance?
  * Why the author thinks it's important?
  * Is it important to us?
  * If it enlighten us, what else follows?

## The Three Kinds of Note-making

1. Structurally

  Answer question 1 & 2.

2. Conceptually

  Answer question 3 & 4.

3. Syntopically

# Chapter 6 Pigeonholing a Book

## Read the title carefully

Two examples:

* "The Origins of Species": the proliferation of a vast number of species, not
just mankind
* "The decline and fall of roman empire": not the rise and fall of it.

## Practical vs. Theoretical Books

Practical book tell what to do, how to do. Have frequent occurrence of "should",
"ought", "good", "bad", "ends", "means". Theoretical book keep saying "is".

# Chapter 7 X-Raying a book

The first 4 stage of analytically reading

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. (The unity of the book)
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts
as you have outlined the whole.
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.

A Book is like a house, each room is independent, but they are connected

## About the stage 2: Stating the unity of a book

Expository works usually tells the unity of their plan. But it's still the duty
of the reader to find it out. Most readers neglect author's introductory words.
Unity can be differently stated.

Examples:

**Herodotus' history (by himself)**

These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes, in
the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done,
and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians
from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their
grounds of feud.

**Aristotle's Ethics**

This is an inquiry into the nature of human happiness and an analysis of the
conditions under which happiness may be gained or lost, with an indication of
what men must do in their conduct and thinking in order to become happy or to
avoid unhappiness, the principal emphasis being placed on the cultivation of
the virtues, both moral and intellectual, although other goods are also recognized
as necessary for happiness, such as wealth, health, friends and a just society
in which to live.

## Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book

Formula: The whole book is about so and so and such and such. (1) The author
accomplished this plan in 5 major parts, the first part is so and so, the 2nd
part is such and such, ... (2) The first of these major part is divided into 3
sections ... (3) The 1st section of 1st part

Good readers need to do it habitually. But we just need to do it approximately,
otherwise it can be an infinite amount work for readers.
Then the authors use US constitution as an example.
The authors also use Ethics of Aristotle as another example. The Ethics has 10 books,
but the outline doesn't have to correspond to the 10 books.
Use authors' sectional division as a guide, but no rely on them passively.
Without step 3, step 2 is just a guess. We need to go through step 2 to understand
how and why we state the unity.

## The reciprocal arts of reading and writing

Reading and writing are reciprocal. Reading needs to find out the skeleton under
the flesh, writing needs to put flesh on the skeleton. (让文章有血有肉).
Writing needs to have unity, clarity and coherence. Clarity means each part of
the writing is distinctive and coherence means all the parts are hanged together
in an orderly disposition.

## Discover authors intention

The readers need to grasp the primary and subordinate questions and their order.
The authors gave some examples of questions.

## The first stage of analytical reading

# Chapter 8 Coming to terms with an author

Next stage is "coming to terms", because term is basic element of communicable
knowledge.

# Chapter 9 Determining an author's messages

## Term

Proposition, Conclusion
Argument, Reason

## Paragraph summary

* Proposition in trading:
    * Definition: proposal, offer, a declaration of intention to act in certain ways.
    * Needs to be clear and attractive
    * Comes before terms.

* Proposition in book writing:
    * Declare of knowledge, something to be true or false.
    * Comes after terms.

* Proposition is opinion if not supported by reasons.
    * More important is how he persuades us.

* Argument is a number of statements related in a certain way, key words like:
    * Because of, if/then, since, therefore ...

* Premises -> argument -> Conclusion

* word -> sentence -> paragraph
* Term -> Proposition -> Argument

* Outlining (work down) Interpretation (work up) meets at Proposition and argument.

### Sentence V.S. Propositions

* Sentence+Paragraph -> grammatical units, Propositions+Arguments -> logical units
  units of thought and knowledge.

* Same difficulties as word and term, language elements and thought elements have
  multiple to multiple mapping.
    * Same sentence can be different propositions: "Reading is learning".
    * One complex sentence can have multiple propositions: one example Machiavelli's The Prince.
      One compound sentence with at least 3 propositions.
