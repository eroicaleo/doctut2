# Introduction

* pg xiii, para ii,
  Benefits of modern nature science and the doctrine of progress envisioned
  by Bacon, Descartes, Locke, Newton. What they called progress, is really a decline in
  terms of virtue and happiness.
* pg xxviii The sciences and arts in themselves are not necessarily corrupting:
  witness the capacities of the likes of Bacon, Descartes, Newton, to pursue
  the science from uncorrupted motives. "If some men must be allowed to give
  themselves over to the study of sciences and arts, it is only those who feel
  they have the strength to walk alone in their footsteps and go beyond them"
* pg xxxii Rousseau thereby signals that Hobbes, Locke, and others in the state
  of nature tradition had adopted the proper mode of inquiry into political and
  moral questions. However, he also argues that they didn't go far enough with
  it. because they falsely assumed that human nature was everywhere the same:
  they spoke of "savage man" and they were depicting "civil man".
* pg xxxiii We seek to know because we desire to have pleasure, and it is not
  possible for someone who had neither desires nor fears would go to the trouble
  of reasoning. ... savage man has very limited passions and therefore very
  limited reason. He comes to have new needs or experiences new passions, his
  reasoning develops in order to satisfy them.
* pg xxxiii human nature is malleable. Humans are "historical" beings. "perfectibility"
  : a faculty which, with the aid of circumstances, successively develops all
  the others and resides among us as much in the species as in the individual,
  whereas an animal is at the end of a few months what it will be all its life
  and its species will be at the end of a thousand years what it was the first
  year of that thousand.
* pg xxxiv human soul has been altered in the bosom of society.
* pg xxxv Same as Hobbes, nature state: egotism, reason is instrument of passion.
  Difference, Hobbes, war of all against all. Rousseau, peaceful. Hobbes, men
  have pride fear of death, competition, war. Rousseau, these are not in state
  of nature.
* pg xxxv human soul: self-love and pity. Self-love is nature feeling. Pride is
  a relative feeling.
