# Introduction

* pg xiii, para ii,
  Benefits of modern nature science and the doctrine of progress envisioned
  by Bacon, Descartes, Locke, Newton. What they called progress, is really a decline in
  terms of virtue and happiness.
* pg xxviii The sciences and arts in themselves are not necessarily corrupting:
  witness the capacities of the likes of Bacon, Descartes, Newton, to pursue
  the science from uncorrupted motives. "If some men must be allowed to give
  themselves over to the study of sciences and arts, it is only those who feel
  they have the strength to walk alone in their footsteps and go beyond them"
* pg xxxii Rousseau thereby signals that Hobbes, Locke, and others in the state
  of nature tradition had adopted the proper mode of inquiry into political and
  moral questions. However, he also argues that they didn't go far enough with
  it. because they falsely assumed that human nature was everywhere the same:
  they spoke of "savage man" and they were depicting "civil man".
* pg xxxiii We seek to know because we desire to have pleasure, and it is not
  possible for someone who had neither desires nor fears would go to the trouble
  of reasoning. ... savage man has very limited passions and therefore very
  limited reason. He comes to have new needs or experiences new passions, his
  reasoning develops in order to satisfy them.
* pg xxxiii human nature is malleable. Humans are "historical" beings. "perfectibility"
  : a faculty which, with the aid of circumstances, successively develops all
  the others and resides among us as much in the species as in the individual,
  whereas an animal is at the end of a few months what it will be all its life
  and its species will be at the end of a thousand years what it was the first
  year of that thousand.
* pg xxxiv human soul has been altered in the bosom of society.
* 摘抄：And how will man ever manage to see himself as nature formed him, through
  all the changes that the sequence of time and of things must have produced
  in his original constitution, and to disentangle what he retains of his own
  stock from what circumstances and his progress have added to or changed in
  his primitive state? Like the statue of Glaucus, which time, sea and storms
  had so disfigured that it resembled less a god than a ferocious beast, the human
  soul, altered in the bosom of society by a thousand continually renewed causes,
  by the acquisition of a mass of knowledge and error, by changes that took place
  in the constitution of bodies, and by the continual impact of the passions, has,
  so to speak, changed in appearance to the point of being almost unrecognizable.
* pg xxxv Same as Hobbes, nature state: egotism, reason is instrument of passion.
  Difference, Hobbes, war of all against all. Rousseau, peaceful. Hobbes, men
  have pride fear of death, competition, war. Rousseau, these are not in state
  of nature.
* pg xxxv human soul: self-love and pity. Self-love is nature feeling. Pride is
  a relative feeling.
* 摘抄：self-love (amour de soi-même) is a nature feeling that inclines every
  animal to look after self-preservation, directed in man by reason and modified
  by pity, produces humanity and virtue. Pride (amour propre) is only a relative
  feeling, fabricated and born in society, that inclines everybody to attach
  more importance to himself than anybody else, that inspires in men all harm
  they do to one another, and that's the true source of honor.
* 摘抄：Finally and centrally for Rousseau's thought, he argues ... that humans
  are naturally "good". Rousseau does not mean by this that humans are naturally
  moral, virtuous and beneficent, since he argues that human originally are not
  social, rational and moral. Rather, humans are naturally "good" in that their
  nature passions and faculties tend toward their self-preservation and well-being
  as individual and as species. ... The nature "goodness" of man consists in
  an equilibrium between his needs and passions and his ability to satisfy them,
  an equilibrium that makes him good for himself and also not dependent on others,
  for it is dependence above all that makes men evil. For Rousseau, it is the
  social relations that are not natural to man that "make a being evil while making
  him sociable, and eventually to bring man and the world from so distant a
  beginning to the point where we now see them."

# Preface

* I believe I perceive in it two principles preceding reason, one of which
  interests us ardently in our well-being and our self-preservation.
