# Introduction to *The Protestant Ethic*

Key word:

ethos 时代精神, but Weber use it same as "ethics" pp. 59 endnotes 15
work
rational, pp. 59 endnotes 13

one important source of modern work ethic and orientation to material success
must be located outside the arena
of market interest, business astuteness, and technology innovation. To a significant
extent, a spirit of *capitalism* - an ethos - originated from realm of religion,
he contends, from a "Protestant ethic" ... These Puritans placed systematic work
and a striving for profit in the middle of their lives for reasons relate to a
consuming question: am I among the saved? Little else appeared to matter greatly
to them, not even family, friends, leisure or hobby.

但是这里没有解释为什么那些“Puritans”把努力工作和得到救赎联系在一起。也许在正文中有解释。

## Controversy over the origin of Capitalism

Intensification of avarice: "The greed for gain" can be found among "all sorts and
conditions of men in all times and in all countries of earth".

# Religion Affiliation and Social Stratification

## section 1 & 2

* Protestants are more likely to be company owner, highly educated skilled workers.
  Not only in Germany but also in other area.
* The religion affiliation might be the cause but can also be the results.
* 16th century, a large number of richest and most developed area turned to Protestants.
  Why?
* 16th reformation, an agreeable dominion was replaced by a infinitely burdensome
  and sever regimentation of organization of believer's life.
* Catholics control is loose, Calvinism's control is unbearable. But some activist
  still complained the domination over life is too little.
* Middle class allowed Puritan tyranny to encompass them and even defend it.

So the logic here is, if people resist the old religion belief, intuitively it's
because the control is too much. But this case is quite contradictory to intuition.

* Protestants parents enroll their children more to "accelerated" tracks and schools
  than Catholic parents. Can this be because the greater transfer of wealth across
  generations by Protestants.
* After "accelerated", Catholic preferred courses emphasis more on languages,
  history, philosophy. Protestants take courses for technique/commercial/industry.
* Catholics remains in craft but Protestants streamed into the factory.
* age-old rule of thumbs: ethnic or religious minorities, as "dominated" groups
  standing opposite a "dominate" group, and as a Consequence of their voluntary
  or involuntary exclusion from influential political positions, have been driven
  to an especially strong degree into the arena of business. E.g. Jews for 2000 years.
* Protestants but not the Catholics have a tendency toward *_economic rationalism_* regardless of whether
  they are dominated or dominate, minority or majority. 所谓经济理性指的是，十六十七世纪，
  西方世界发展出的一种资本主义精神，其特点是，运用科学的方法，系统地组织劳动力和生产过程，使得
  生产力不断得到质的提高。

So the logic here is there must be some inner qualities difference between Catholics
and Protestants other than historical-political situation.

## section 3

* Superficial consideration: Catholics are more indifferent to material and consumer
  good from the ascetic feature of their highest ideas.
    * Germany Protestants criticize Catholics' ascetic way of life.
    * Catholics reproach Protestants' secularization of very meaning of life.
    * Popular German maxim: One can either eat well (Protestants) or sleep well (Catholics)

* YG: 接下来改如何反驳这种观点呢？
* Eat well can characterize part of the Protestants in Germany today. In the past,
  the opposite would characterize the Puritans.
* YG:看来以今非古的换习惯，不只是读红楼梦会有，世界上到处都有。
* French protestants (Huguenots) retained a severity rather than a nature enjoyment
  of life. They are the most important carrier of industrial and capitalist development
  in France.
* French calvinists are as estranged from the world as the northern Germany Catholics
  and they are minorities in their country. Lower-status French Catholics are enjoying
  of life. Lower-status German Protestants immersed in business life.
* YG:按照逻辑来说，自然要举出新教徒不追求世俗生活和享乐。天主教徒也追求世俗生活和享乐。

## section 4

* YG:反驳了观点之后总该亮明自己的观点了吧。果然，韦伯发问以亮明观点。
* Could the contrast between estrangement from the world on the one hand,
  and earning of living under capitalism on the other hand, be understood actually
  as implying an inner affinity?
* YG:结下来要论证，先摆个事实，举个例子：
* high number of persons affiliated with the most spiritual forms of Christian piety
  came from business-oriented social cycles.
* YG:这个例子看似违反直觉，所以退一步提出反对者可能会有的观点。
* More spiritually inclined people are less well adapted to vocations in commerce
  and sales
* Money and wealth have a vulgar, evil and debasing influence.
* YG:再退一步，来一个似是而非的例子：
* The conspicuous occurrence that unusually successful capitalist entrepreneurs
  are sons of ministers can be explained as a reaction against ascetic upbringing.
* YG:该反驳这个观点，以上的观点是简单的二元对立（和欧老师红楼梦的思路一样）。以上的观点无法解释
  下列事实：
* The virtuoso business sense combines in the same person, the same group of person,
  with the most intense forms of piety that penetrate and order the believers' entire life.
* YG:反驳之后，提出进一步观点
* This combination constitutes precisely the distinguish aspect for whole groups
  of the historically most important Protestant sects and churches.
* YG:举出各个例子说明这是characteristics and typical：
* monks and industrialist proselytized into Huguenot church.
  Spaniards "heresy" (Calvinist from Netherland) "promoted the spirit of commerce".

## section 5

* YG:再举出另外两种似是而非的解释说明并不是Calvinist的宗教信仰使得德国，法国的经济迅速发展。
  观点1:这两个本来经济底子就好。观点2:The powerful effect of exile and the uprooting
  it entailed from life's customary and traditional relationship.
* YG:观点2更容易被混淆，所以韦伯特意在脚注里聚了例子。韦伯的例子说波兰的懒姑娘到了德国的劳动营
  就像是爆发出了无穷无尽的动力。另外意大利劳工也有类似现象。更不用说美国的发展有极大的成都依赖这种
  现象：Working in a completely unaccustomed and different surrounding breaks through
  the worker's traditional ways - and this new milieu is the "socializing" force.
  但是韦伯进一步说，如果对比新英格兰地区，马里兰地区和南方，因为宗教信仰的不同，还是可以看到差异。
* Not all Protestant denominations exhibited an equally strong effect on capitalism
  growth. Calvinists are stronger while Lutheranism are weaker.
* Even more striking is the connection of regimentation of religion and the intense
  development of business sense. The sects whose "estrangement from life" become
  as familiar as their wealth.
    * Quakers in England and USA
    * Mennonites in Germany and Netherland
    * Pieties in Germany
* YG:怎么感觉像扫地老僧说的，慈悲之心越重的人，练武功能练的更好。

## section 6

* YG:这一节第一段就下了两个结论：
* 1. The "spirit of work" should not be understood as implying as a natural and
  uncomplicated "enjoyment of life".
* 2. Should not be comprehended as "enlightenment". The founders had very little
  to do with what is called today progress.
* YG:第二点的意思说资本主义精神不是被启发出来的，因为按照教义，很多现在觉得对的事情都不被创始人
  鼓励。
* This affinity should not be Protestant spirit's alleged materialistic, anti-ascetic,
  and enjoyment of life, should focus on purely religion feature. Montesquieu: English "
  farther than other people in three important ways: in respect to piety, commerce and
  freedom". Can the last two be attributed to the first one?
* Must penetrate to the quality characteristics and distinctiveness of the great
  religious world of thought given to us historically in the diverse form of Christian.
* YG: 所以韦伯接下来要讲一下基督教不同教派的独特个性。

# Chapter 2 The "spirit" of capitalism

* YG:这个概念很难用几句话表达清楚。
* The concept is only meaningful for a specific historical case, which is a complex
  of relationship in historical reality.
* The concept must be gradually put together from its single component parts,
  each of which is taken out of historical reality.
* YG:韦伯要在最后才能给定义。
* Our vantage points are not the only possible ones that the historical cases
  can be analyzed. whatever one understands by a "spirit" of capitalism by no means
  can or must correspond to that which we will note as essential in our exegesis.
* YG:韦伯这里就强调说人文科学是可以从多个角度来理解的。
* Weber's methodology: to order reality into tangible, causal connections that are
  stable and unavoidable of a unique character.
* YG:韦伯说不能从定义概念开始，先从例子开始说。举了富兰克林的一段话。韦伯接着说，富兰克林
  的话很能体现资本主义精神，并且涵盖资本主义精神的全部。
* Indeed, rather than simply a common-sense approach to life, a peculiar "ethic"
  is preached here: it's violation is treated not simply as foolishness but as
  a sort of forgetfulness of duty. Above all, this distinction stands at the center
  of the matter. "Business savvy", which is found commonly
  enough, is here not alone taught; rather an ethos is expressed in this maxim.
* YG: 韦伯说富兰克林这段话的精神在于，认为，挣钱，省钱不仅是一种生活方式，而是一种伦理。如果
  没做到，那不是聪明和傻的问题，是负责不负责的问题。
* Jocab Fugger example: "enough wealth and should allow others their chance" is
  "contemptible timidity", "wanted to simply to make money as long as he could"
* Fugger's spirit must be distinguished from Franklin's. The spirit of modern
  capitalism is missing in China, India, Babylon and middle age.
* YG: 韦伯应该说说这种 spirit of modern capitalism 和别的资本主义什么区别吧。
* YG: 接下来，韦伯说Franklin这种关于美德的论述很容易被贴上功利主义的标签，whoever reads
  in his autobiography, ... will necessarily come to the conclusion that all
  virtues, according to Franklin, becomes virtues only to the extent that they
  are useful to the individuals. The surrogate of virtue - namely, its appearance only -
  is fully adequate wherever the same purpose is achieved.
  这是功利主义所不可避免的，因为the inseparability of motive and appearance of utilitarianism.
  所以韦伯说，很多德国人倾向于认为美国人的美德和虚伪，也是这个原因。大概因为美国人的virtue很容易
  和功利主义混淆在一起，看来和我表姐的印象查不多。

## section 2.1

* Franklin is of candor and trustfulness. He believed the realization can be traced
  back to a revelation that was designed to guide him to the path of righteousness.
* YG: 以下这点非常重要：
* The acquisition of money, and more and more money takes places simultaneously
  with the strictest avoidance of all spontaneous enjoyment of it.
* Here, people are oriented to acquisition as the purpose of life; acquisition is
  no longer viewed as a means to the end of satisfying the substantive needs of life.
  ... Yet this reversal constitutes just as surely a guiding principle of modern
  capitalism as incomprehension of this new situation which characterizes all
  who remain untouched by modern capitalism tentacles.
* YG: 韦伯在这一段里以及这一段的一个脚注就说的好，这种行为从“快乐”和“实用”的角度来看是irrational
  的，在现代人看了简直是违背了人的天性。脚注里说，某人批判这种行为是一种朝着非理性生活的理性努力。
  韦伯说批判的好呀！Something is never "irrational" in itself but only from a particular
  "rational" vantage point. For the nonreligious person every religious way of
  organizing life is irrational; for the hedonist every ascetic organizing of life
  is "irrational" even if it may be, measured against its ultimate values,
  a "rationalization".
* YG: 以上精彩。和欧丽娟老师说的不要拿现代人的民主自由的观点去把礼教，儒家思想批的一文不值。
  真理的对立面也可以是真理。欧丽娟老师引菜根谭：“淡泊之士，必為濃艷者所疑；檢飾之人，多為放肆者
  所忌。君子處此，固不可少變其操履，亦不可太露其鋒芒。”放在这里也蛮合适的。＃横向读书＃
* YG: 我有个问题，是不是只有以上这一点构成了modern capitalism和之前的资本主义的区别？这一
  点看起来很容易理解。。。
* As long as it is carried out in a legal manner, acquisition of money in the
  modern economic order is the result and manifestation of competency and
  proficiency in a vocational calling. And the competency and proficiency is
  the actual alpha and omega of Franklin's morality.
* YG: 之前描述的应该算是资本主义精神的表象，那以上这一段就把它联系到一个religious idea,也就是
  vocational calling.
* YG: 接下来这一段就是说"duty to have vocational calling"
    * 首先是重要性：characteristics of social ethics of modern capitalism culture,
      even of constitutive significance.
    * 接着解释一番：notion of duty that individuals ought to experience, and do,
      vis-a-vis, the contents of the vocational activities.
    * 进一步阐述其特点：regardless of particular nature of the activities and
      regardless, especially of whether this activity seems to involve nothing
      more than the simply utilization of their capacity for labor or their
      treatment of it as only a material possession.
* YG: 问题又来了，这种"vocational calling"好像和acquisition of money没什么关系吗？
* It is surely not the case that the idea of duty in one's vocational calling
  could grow only on the soil of modern capitalism. And can be traced to a period
  prior to modern capitalism.
* YG: 接下来说，现代的人生于这种制度下，已经不自觉地需要遵守资本主义的伦理规范(ethical maxim)，
  要不然就会被时代淘汰，工厂倒闭，工人失业。摘抄如下：
* Naturally it would be argued even less that, under today's capitalism, the
  subjective acquisition of these ethical maxim by capitalism's particular
  social carriers (such as business persons or workers in modern capitalist
  company) constitutes a condition for capitalism's further existence.
* Rather, the capitalist economic order of today is a vast cosmos into which a
  person is born. It simply exists, to each person, as a factually unalterable
  casing in which he or she must live. To the extent that people are interwoven
  into the context of capitalism's market forces, the norms of its economic action
  are forced onto them.
* YG: 接下来这一段，韦伯思路清晰，现代资本主义似乎是被历史进程所选择的。那么既然要被选择，那么
  符合现代资本主义的生活方式，行为习惯乃至思想概念，就必须先产生并且存在着，要不怎么选？韦伯说
  资本主义创造了它所需要的人。这是不是有点时势造英雄的味道。或者，天下大势，浩浩荡荡，顺之者昌，
  逆之者亡。我又想到了《人类简史》里说的意识形态是会传染的，它们先微生物一样只顾着自己扩张。
  摘抄如下：
* Thus through a process of economic selection, the capitalism that today dominates
  economic life socializes and creates the economic functionaries that it needs,
  both owners of business and workers. ... In order for a particular organized
  life and a particular conception of a vocational calling adapted to the uniqueness
  of modern capitalism to be "selected", obviously they must have originated among
  , and as a mode of thinking be carried by, groups of persons rather than simply
  by isolated individuals.
* YG: 我的理解，以上两段的是说，人们先具有了资本主义精神，接着行程了特定的资本主义社会和经济秩序，
  然后，反过来了这样的社会和经济秩序再来创造和选择符合它的人。

## section 2.2

* YG: 第一段，探讨资本主义精神和资本主义经济孰因孰果的问题。历史唯物主义认为，资本主义经济先于
  资本主义精神。韦伯则用新英格兰地区和南方各州做对比。新英格兰地区虽然经济不发达，那里的人们却
  具有本书要讨论的资本主义精神。南方则正好相反。摘抄如下：
* In contrast, the New England colonies were called into existence for religious
  reasons by ministers and seminary graduates, together with small-scale merchants,
  craftsmen, and farmers. Thus, in this case at any rate, the causal relationship
  between ideas and economic situations lies in the direction opposite from that
  which would be postulated by the "materialist" argument.
* YG: 这一段不难，说了资本主义精神的萌芽时期，像富兰克林这样的想法是被禁止的。这也是欧丽娟老师
  一再在红楼梦课程中教育我们的，每个时代的价值观都不一样。要理解古人，一定要回到古人的时代背景去
  理解。摘抄如下：
  The youth of these ideas - the spirit of capitalism ... and its unfolding does
  not proceed in the manner of the blossoming of flower. The capitalist spirit,
  ... become prominent only after a difficult struggle against a world of hostile
  power. The frame of mind apparent in the cited passages from B.F. that met with
  the approval of an entire people would have been proscribed in the ancient world,
  as well as in the Middle Age, for it would have been viewed as an expression of
  filthy greed and a completely undignified character.
* YG: 接下来这一段，韦伯解释说，对现代资本主义精神的敌意并不是因为以前的人没有那么贪婪，对金钱
  没有那么渴望。如果用贪婪和对金钱的渴望作为划分标准，那么就无法区分资本家和另外一些贪婪的人的区别了。
* YG: 再接下来这一段，韦伯对比意大利资本主义的落后和德国的先进，以此说明，若资本家一味贪婪，工人们
  也不勤勉努力，没有人遵守一定的伦理规范，这样是发展不出现代资本主义的。所以“对金钱的本能追求”
  并不是资本主义精神发展的决定因素。摘抄如下：
  The universal sway of absolute unscrupulousness in establishing one's own self-interest
  as the legitimate operating assumption for the pursuit of money has been
  specifically characteristic of precisely those countries where the unfolding of
  a middle class capitalism has remained "backward".
  The absence of conscientiousness among workers in such nations (such as Italy
  in comparison to Germany) has been, and to a certain extent still is, the major
  obstacle to the unfolding of modern capitalism, as every factory employer knows.
  Modern capitalism has as little use for easygoing persons as laborers as it has
  for the businessman fully without scruples in running of his company, as we
  already have learned from Franklin.
  an "instinct" to pursue money cannot be said to be a decisive issue.
* YG: 接下来这一段，韦伯说对他人或者别国的资源地无羞耻地掠夺，自古就有。所以也不是现代资本主义
  的特征。摘抄如下：
  The auri sacra fames is as old as the history of humanity known to us. We shall
  see that those who without reservation surrendered themselves to it as an instinct,
  the Dutch captain, for example, who "would sail through hell for profit, even
  if he burns his sails" -  were in no way representatives of that frame of mind
  from which the specifically modern capitalist "spirit" burst forth as a mass
  phenomenon.
  This is what matters here. Acquisition unrestrained by internally binding norms
  has existed in all periods of history; indeed, it has existed wherever its
  expression was not circumscribed. In relationships across tribes and among
  peoples fundamentally unknown to each other, as well as in warfare and piracy,
  trade unbounded by norms has been the rule. A double standard prevailed in
  such situations: practices considered as taboo "among" brothers were permitted
  with "outsiders".
* YG: 以资本来谋求利润的经济形式古已有之，与之并存的是一些富于冒险精神的人。他们敢于蔑视一切既有
  的伦理规范。
  As an "adventure", capitalist acquisition has found a place in all those
  economies that have known valuable objects as quasi-money forms of exchange
  and offered the chance to utilize them for profit. ... Coexisting everywhere
  with these external modes of economic organization were persons with an
  adventurous frame of mind - who mocked all ethical restrictions on action.
* YG: 这里我想韦伯想要把这些人和Franklin这样的现代资本家区分开来，因为这些人，Moreover their
  absolute and willfully ruthless striving for profit often stood hard and fast
  alongside a strict adherence to age-old tradition. 我的问题是什么是age-old tradition?
  是上一段说的海盗，或者侵略行为吗？接下来韦伯说，as these traditions began to disintegrate,
  a more or less broad ranging expansion of an unrestrained quest for gain took
  place and intruded even into the core of social group. 我的问题是什么时候旧传统就
  分崩离析了？
* YG: 韦伯说这样的 An ethical affirmation and shaping of this new situation did not
  follow. Rather, this unrestrained quest for gain was tolerated as a new reality and
  was treated with ethical indifference or as a disagreeable, but unavoidable
  presence.
* YG: 我们就看看孔子如何对待获取财富。韦伯的这段话，点评的很好呀。＃横向读书＃
  《述而》：富而可求也，虽执鞭之士，吾亦为之。如不可求，从吾所好。
  《述而》：不义而富且贵，于我如浮云。
* YG: 接下来韦伯说，这样的toleration是前现代资本主义的一般特征，也是阻碍资本主义精神发展的主要
  障碍。在这里韦伯第一次直接地概述了一下现代资本主义。所以我就全篇摘录了。
  This was the normal position taken by all ethnical teachings. Furthermore,
  and of more essential importance, this position characterized the practical
  behavior of the average person in the epoch prior to modern capitalism - that
  is, before a rational use of capital in a managed manner and a systematic
  capitalist organization of work became the dominate forces determining the
  orientation of economic activity. However, this toleration of the unrestrained
  quest for gain constituted everywhere one of the strongest inner barrier against
  the adaptation of persons to the preconditions of an organized, mid-class
  capitalist economy.
* YG: 本节最后一段摘抄：
  In the sense of a certain norm-bound style of life that has crystallized in the
  form of an "ethic," the spirit of capitalism has had to struggle primarily against
  a specific opponent: that type of experiencing, perceiving and ordering of
  the world we can denote **economic traditionalism**.
* YG: 本节小节：韦伯从先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题说起，举了北美殖民地的例子说明，意识形态先于经济形式的
  发展。接着，韦伯指出意识形态的发展并不是一帆风顺，是和传统的意识形态经行了一番斗争之后才建立
  起来的。传统的伦理只需对于instinct to pursue money/auri sacra fames/unrestrained
  quest for gain总是持负面态度。现代资本主义很容易被和这样的行为画上等号，但其实它们古已有之，
  所以并不能把这些行为当作是现代资本主义的价值观。最后一段承上启下，指出现代资本主义的最主要的对手
  是经济传统主义。我实在又忍不住要感叹：三观太重要了。思想决定行动。。。
