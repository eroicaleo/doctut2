# Introduction to *The Protestant Ethic*

Key word:

ethos 时代精神, but Weber use it same as "ethics" pp. 59 endnotes 15
work
rational, pp. 59 endnotes 13

one important source of modern work ethic and orientation to material success
must be located outside the arena
of market interest, business astuteness, and technology innovation. To a significant
extent, a spirit of *capitalism* - an ethos - originated from realm of religion,
he contends, from a "Protestant ethic" ... These Puritans placed systematic work
and a striving for profit in the middle of their lives for reasons relate to a
consuming question: am I among the saved? Little else appeared to matter greatly
to them, not even family, friends, leisure or hobby.

但是这里没有解释为什么那些“Puritans”把努力工作和得到救赎联系在一起。也许在正文中有解释。

## Controversy over the origin of Capitalism

Intensification of avarice: "The greed for gain" can be found among "all sorts and
conditions of men in all times and in all countries of earth".

# Religion Affiliation and Social Stratification

## section 1 & 2

* Protestants are more likely to be company owner, highly educated skilled workers.
  Not only in Germany but also in other area.
* The religion affiliation might be the cause but can also be the results.
* 16th century, a large number of richest and most developed area turned to Protestants.
  Why?
* 16th reformation, an agreeable dominion was replaced by a infinitely burdensome
  and sever regimentation of organization of believer's life.
* Catholics control is loose, Calvinism's control is unbearable. But some activist
  still complained the domination over life is too little.
* Middle class allowed Puritan tyranny to encompass them and even defend it.

So the logic here is, if people resist the old religion belief, intuitively it's
because the control is too much. But this case is quite contradictory to intuition.

* Protestants parents enroll their children more to "accelerated" tracks and schools
  than Catholic parents. Can this be because the greater transfer of wealth across
  generations by Protestants.
* After "accelerated", Catholic preferred courses emphasis more on languages,
  history, philosophy. Protestants take courses for technique/commercial/industry.
* Catholics remains in craft but Protestants streamed into the factory.
* age-old rule of thumbs: ethnic or religious minorities, as "dominated" groups
  standing opposite a "dominate" group, and as a Consequence of their voluntary
  or involuntary exclusion from influential political positions, have been driven
  to an especially strong degree into the arena of business. E.g. Jews for 2000 years.
* Protestants but not the Catholics have a tendency toward *_economic rationalism_* regardless of whether
  they are dominated or dominate, minority or majority. 所谓经济理性指的是，十六十七世纪，
  西方世界发展出的一种资本主义精神，其特点是，运用科学的方法，系统地组织劳动力和生产过程，使得
  生产力不断得到质的提高。

So the logic here is there must be some inner qualities difference between Catholics
and Protestants other than historical-political situation.

## section 3

* Superficial consideration: Catholics are more indifferent to material and consumer
  good from the ascetic feature of their highest ideas.
    * Germany Protestants criticize Catholics' ascetic way of life.
    * Catholics reproach Protestants' secularization of very meaning of life.
    * Popular German maxim: One can either eat well (Protestants) or sleep well (Catholics)

* [YG]: 接下来改如何反驳这种观点呢？
* Eat well can characterize part of the Protestants in Germany today. In the past,
  the opposite would characterize the Puritans.
* [YG]:看来以今非古的换习惯，不只是读红楼梦会有，世界上到处都有。
* French protestants (Huguenots) retained a severity rather than a nature enjoyment
  of life. They are the most important carrier of industrial and capitalist development
  in France.
* French calvinists are as estranged from the world as the northern Germany Catholics
  and they are minorities in their country. Lower-status French Catholics are enjoying
  of life. Lower-status German Protestants immersed in business life.
* [YG]:按照逻辑来说，自然要举出新教徒不追求世俗生活和享乐。天主教徒也追求世俗生活和享乐。

## section 4

* [YG]:反驳了观点之后总该亮明自己的观点了吧。果然，韦伯发问以亮明观点。
* Could the contrast between estrangement from the world on the one hand,
  and earning of living under capitalism on the other hand, be understood actually
  as implying an inner affinity?
* [YG]:结下来要论证，先摆个事实，举个例子：
* high number of persons affiliated with the most spiritual forms of Christian piety
  came from business-oriented social cycles.
* [YG]:这个例子看似违反直觉，所以退一步提出反对者可能会有的观点。
* More spiritually inclined people are less well adapted to vocations in commerce
  and sales
* Money and wealth have a vulgar, evil and debasing influence.
* [YG]:再退一步，来一个似是而非的例子：
* The conspicuous occurrence that unusually successful capitalist entrepreneurs
  are sons of ministers can be explained as a reaction against ascetic upbringing.
* [YG]:该反驳这个观点，以上的观点是简单的二元对立（和欧老师红楼梦的思路一样）。以上的观点无法解释
  下列事实：
* The virtuoso business sense combines in the same person, the same group of person,
  with the most intense forms of piety that penetrate and order the believers' entire life.
* [YG]:反驳之后，提出进一步观点
* This combination constitutes precisely the distinguish aspect for whole groups
  of the historically most important Protestant sects and churches.
* [YG]:举出各个例子说明这是characteristics and typical：
* monks and industrialist proselytized into Huguenot church.
  Spaniards "heresy" (Calvinist from Netherland) "promoted the spirit of commerce".

## section 5

* [YG]:再举出另外两种似是而非的解释说明并不是Calvinist的宗教信仰使得德国，法国的经济迅速发展。
  观点1:这两个本来经济底子就好。观点2:The powerful effect of exile and the uprooting
  it entailed from life's customary and traditional relationship.
* [YG]:观点2更容易被混淆，所以韦伯特意在脚注里聚了例子。韦伯的例子说波兰的懒姑娘到了德国的劳动营
  就像是爆发出了无穷无尽的动力。另外意大利劳工也有类似现象。更不用说美国的发展有极大的成都依赖这种
  现象：Working in a completely unaccustomed and different surrounding breaks through
  the worker's traditional ways - and this new milieu is the "socializing" force.
  但是韦伯进一步说，如果对比新英格兰地区，马里兰地区和南方，因为宗教信仰的不同，还是可以看到差异。
* Not all Protestant denominations exhibited an equally strong effect on capitalism
  growth. Calvinists are stronger while Lutheranism are weaker.
* Even more striking is the connection of regimentation of religion and the intense
  development of business sense. The sects whose "estrangement from life" become
  as familiar as their wealth.
    * Quakers in England and USA
    * Mennonites in Germany and Netherland
    * Pieties in Germany
* [YG]:怎么感觉像扫地老僧说的，慈悲之心越重的人，练武功能练的更好。

## section 6

* [YG]:这一节第一段就下了两个结论：
* 1. The "spirit of work" should not be understood as implying as a natural and
  uncomplicated "enjoyment of life".
* 2. Should not be comprehended as "enlightenment". The founders had very little
  to do with what is called today progress.
* [YG]:第二点的意思说资本主义精神不是被启发出来的，因为按照教义，很多现在觉得对的事情都不被创始人
  鼓励。
* This affinity should not be Protestant spirit's alleged materialistic, anti-ascetic,
  and enjoyment of life, should focus on purely religion feature. Montesquieu: English "
  farther than other people in three important ways: in respect to piety, commerce and
  freedom". Can the last two be attributed to the first one?
* Must penetrate to the quality characteristics and distinctiveness of the great
  religious world of thought given to us historically in the diverse form of Christian.
* [YG]: 所以韦伯接下来要讲一下基督教不同教派的独特个性。

# Chapter 2 The "spirit" of capitalism

* [YG]:这个概念很难用几句话表达清楚。
* The concept is only meaningful for a specific historical case, which is a complex
  of relationship in historical reality.
* The concept must be gradually put together from its single component parts,
  each of which is taken out of historical reality.
* [YG]:韦伯要在最后才能给定义。
* Our vantage points are not the only possible ones that the historical cases
  can be analyzed. whatever one understands by a "spirit" of capitalism by no means
  can or must correspond to that which we will note as essential in our exegesis.
* [YG]:韦伯这里就强调说人文科学是可以从多个角度来理解的。
* Weber's methodology: to order reality into tangible, causal connections that are
  stable and unavoidable of a unique character.
* [YG]:韦伯说不能从定义概念开始，先从例子开始说。举了富兰克林的一段话。韦伯接着说，富兰克林
  的话很能体现资本主义精神，并且涵盖资本主义精神的全部。
* Indeed, rather than simply a common-sense approach to life, a peculiar "ethic"
  is preached here: it's violation is treated not simply as foolishness but as
  a sort of forgetfulness of duty. Above all, this distinction stands at the center
  of the matter. "Business savvy", which is found commonly
  enough, is here not alone taught; rather an ethos is expressed in this maxim.
* [YG]: 韦伯说富兰克林这段话的精神在于，认为，挣钱，省钱不仅是一种生活方式，而是一种伦理。如果
  没做到，那不是聪明和傻的问题，是负责不负责的问题。
* Jocab Fugger example: "enough wealth and should allow others their chance" is
  "contemptible timidity", "wanted to simply to make money as long as he could"
* Fugger's spirit must be distinguished from Franklin's. The spirit of modern
  capitalism is missing in China, India, Babylon and middle age.
* [YG]: 韦伯应该说说这种 spirit of modern capitalism 和别的资本主义什么区别吧。
* [YG]: 接下来，韦伯说Franklin这种关于美德的论述很容易被贴上功利主义的标签，whoever reads
  in his autobiography, ... will necessarily come to the conclusion that all
  virtues, according to Franklin, becomes virtues only to the extent that they
  are useful to the individuals. The surrogate of virtue - namely, its appearance only -
  is fully adequate wherever the same purpose is achieved.
  这是功利主义所不可避免的，因为the inseparability of motive and appearance of utilitarianism.
  所以韦伯说，很多德国人倾向于认为美国人的美德和虚伪，也是这个原因。大概因为美国人的virtue很容易
  和功利主义混淆在一起，看来和我表姐的印象查不多。

## section 2.1

* Franklin is of candor and trustfulness. He believed the realization can be traced
  back to a revelation that was designed to guide him to the path of righteousness.
* YG: 以下这点非常重要：
* The acquisition of money, and more and more money takes places simultaneously
  with the strictest avoidance of all spontaneous enjoyment of it.
* Here, people are oriented to acquisition as the purpose of life; acquisition is
  no longer viewed as a means to the end of satisfying the substantive needs of life.
  ... Yet this reversal constitutes just as surely a guiding principle of modern
  capitalism as incomprehension of this new situation which characterizes all
  who remain untouched by modern capitalism tentacles.
* [YG]: 韦伯在这一段里以及这一段的一个脚注就说的好，这种行为从“快乐”和“实用”的角度来看是irrational
  的，在现代人看了简直是违背了人的天性。脚注里说，某人批判这种行为是一种朝着非理性生活的理性努力。
  韦伯说批判的好呀！Something is never "irrational" in itself but only from a particular
  "rational" vantage point. For the nonreligious person every religious way of
  organizing life is irrational; for the hedonist every ascetic organizing of life
  is "irrational" even if it may be, measured against its ultimate values,
  a "rationalization".
* [YG]: 以上精彩。和欧丽娟老师说的不要拿现代人的民主自由的观点去把礼教，儒家思想批的一文不值。
  真理的对立面也可以是真理。欧丽娟老师引菜根谭：“淡泊之士，必為濃艷者所疑；檢飾之人，多為放肆者
  所忌。君子處此，固不可少變其操履，亦不可太露其鋒芒。”放在这里也蛮合适的。
* [YG]: 我有个问题，是不是只有以上这一点构成了modern capitalism和之前的资本主义的区别？这一
  点看起来很容易理解。。。
* As long as it is carried out in a legal manner, acquisition of money in the
  modern economic order is the result and manifestation of competency and
  proficiency in a vocational calling. And the competency and proficiency is
  the actual alpha and omega of Franklin's morality.
* [YG]: 之前描述的应该算是资本主义精神的表象，那以上这一段就把它联系到一个religious idea,也就是
  vocational calling.
* [YG]: 接下来这一段就是说"duty to have vocational calling"
    * 首先是重要性：characteristics of social ethics of modern capitalism culture,
      even of constitutive significance.
    * 接着解释一番：notion of duty that individuals ought to experience, and do,
      vis-a-vis, the contents of the vocational activities.
    * 进一步阐述其特点：regardless of particular nature of the activities and
      regardless, especially of whether this activity seems to involve nothing
      more than the simply utilization of their capacity for labor or their
      treatment of it as only a material possession.
* [YG]: 问题又来了，这种"vocational calling"好像和acquisition of money没什么关系吗？
* It is surely not the case that the idea of duty in one's vocational calling
  could grow only on the soil of modern capitalism. And can be traced to a period
  prior to modern capitalism.
* [YG]: 接下来说，现代的人生于这种制度下，已经不自觉地需要遵守资本主义的伦理规范(ethical maxim)，
  要不然就会被时代淘汰，工厂倒闭，工人失业。
* Rather, the capitalist economic order of today is a vast cosmos into which a
  person is born. It simply exists, to each person, as a factually unalterable
  casing in which he or she must live. To the extent that people are interwoven
  into the context of capitalism's market forces, the norms of its economic action
  are forced onto them.
