# Introduction to *The Protestant Ethic*

Key word:

ethos 时代精神, but Weber use it same as "ethics" pp. 59 endnotes 15
work
rational, pp. 59 endnotes 13

one important source of modern work ethic and orientation to material success
must be located outside the arena
of market interest, business astuteness, and technology innovation. To a significant
extent, a spirit of *capitalism* - an ethos - originated from realm of religion,
he contends, from a "Protestant ethic" ... These Puritans placed systematic work
and a striving for profit in the middle of their lives for reasons relate to a
consuming question: am I among the saved? Little else appeared to matter greatly
to them, not even family, friends, leisure or hobby.

但是这里没有解释为什么那些“Puritans”把努力工作和得到救赎联系在一起。也许在正文中有解释。

## Controversy over the origin of Capitalism

Intensification of avarice: "The greed for gain" can be found among "all sorts and
conditions of men in all times and in all countries of earth".

# Religion Affiliation and Social Stratification

## section 1 & 2

* Protestants are more likely to be company owner, highly educated skilled workers.
  Not only in Germany but also in other area.
* The religion affiliation might be the cause but can also be the results.
* 16th century, a large number of richest and most developed area turned to Protestants.
  Why?
* 16th reformation, an agreeable dominion was replaced by a infinitely burdensome
  and sever regimentation of organization of believer's life.
* Catholics control is loose, Calvinism's control is unbearable. But some activist
  still complained the domination over life is too little.
* Middle class allowed Puritan tyranny to encompass them and even defend it.

So the logic here is, if people resist the old religion belief, intuitively it's
because the control is too much. But this case is quite contradictory to intuition.

* Protestants parents enroll their children more to "accelerated" tracks and schools
  than Catholic parents. Can this be because the greater transfer of wealth across
  generations by Protestants.
* After "accelerated", Catholic preferred courses emphasis more on languages,
  history, philosophy. Protestants take courses for technique/commercial/industry.
* Catholics remains in craft but Protestants streamed into the factory.
* age-old rule of thumbs: ethnic or religious minorities, as "dominated" groups
  standing opposite a "dominate" group, and as a Consequence of their voluntary
  or involuntary exclusion from influential political positions, have been driven
  to an especially strong degree into the arena of business. E.g. Jews for 2000 years.
* Protestants but not the Catholics have a tendency toward *_economic rationalism_* regardless of whether
  they are dominated or dominate, minority or majority. 所谓经济理性指的是，十六十七世纪，
  西方世界发展出的一种资本主义精神，其特点是，运用科学的方法，系统地组织劳动力和生产过程，使得
  生产力不断得到质的提高。

So the logic here is there must be some inner qualities difference between Catholics
and Protestants other than historical-political situation.

## section 3

* Superficial consideration: Catholics are more indifferent to material and consumer
  good from the ascetic feature of their highest ideas.
    * Germany Protestants criticize Catholics' ascetic way of life.
    * Catholics reproach Protestants' secularization of very meaning of life.
    * Popular German maxim: One can either eat well (Protestants) or sleep well (Catholics)

* [YG]: 接下来改如何反驳这种观点呢？
* Eat well can characterize part of the Protestants in Germany today. In the past,
  the opposite would characterize the Puritans.
* [YG]:看来以今非古的换习惯，不只是读红楼梦会有，世界上到处都有。
* French protestants (Huguenots) retained a severity rather than a nature enjoyment
  of life. They are the most important carrier of industrial and capitalist development
  in France.
* French calvinists are as estranged from the world as the northern Germany Catholics
  and they are minorities in their country. Lower-status French Catholics are enjoying
  of life. Lower-status German Protestants immersed in business life.
* [YG]:按照逻辑来说，自然要举出新教徒不追求世俗生活和享乐。天主教徒也追求世俗生活和享乐。

## section 4

* [YG]:反驳了观点之后总该亮明自己的观点了吧。果然，韦伯发问以亮明观点。
* Could the contrast between estrangement from the world on the one hand,
  and earning of living under capitalism on the other hand, be understood actually
  as implying an inner affinity?
* [YG]:结下来要论证，先摆个事实，举个例子：
* high number of persons affiliated with the most spiritual forms of Christian piety
  came from business-oriented social cycles.
* [YG]:这个例子看似违反直觉，所以退一步提出反对者可能会有的观点。
* More spiritually inclined people are less well adapted to vocations in commerce
  and sales
* Money and wealth have a vulgar, evil and debasing influence.
* [YG]:再退一步，来一个似是而非的例子：
* The conspicuous occurrence that unusually successful capitalist entrepreneurs
  are sons of ministers can be explained as a reaction against ascetic upbringing.
* [YG]:该反驳这个观点，以上的观点是简单的二元对立（和欧老师红楼梦的思路一样）。以上的观点无法解释
  下列事实：
* The virtuoso business sense combines in the same person, the same group of person,
  with the most intense forms of piety that penetrate and order the believers' entire life.
* [YG]:反驳之后，提出进一步观点
* This combination constitutes precisely the distinguish aspect for whole groups
  of the historically most important Protestant sects and churches.
* [YG]:举出各个例子说明这是characteristics and typical：
* monks and industrialist proselytized into Huguenot church.
  Spaniards "heresy" (Calvinist from Netherland) "promoted the spirit of commerce".

## section 5

* [YG]:再举出另外两种似是而非的解释说明并不是Calvinist的宗教信仰使得德国，法国的经济迅速发展。
  观点1:这两个本来经济底子就好。观点2:The powerful effect of exile and the uprooting
  it entailed from life's customary and traditional relationship.
* [YG]:观点2更容易被混淆，所以韦伯特意在脚注里聚了例子。
