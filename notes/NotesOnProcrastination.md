# Ch00 A note to our readers

* Reason for 25 yr updates: new culture context, new perspectives, then new
  formulation of procrastination.
    * psychological understanding
    * neuroscience
    * behavior economic
* 2007 Steel's literature review identified 4 main reasons:
    * low confidence in success
    * task aversiveness, distractibility
    * goals/rewards too far
* No matter the time or place, there is something for everyone to procrastinate
* overburdens of information leads us into procrastination.
* procrastination is complex interweaving of individual psychological, behavior,
  emotional issue, social, culture, technological dynamics, biological and
  neurological predispositions, and universal human tendencies.
* Two points as 25 yr ago:
    * understanding: don't know why, then techniques won't help
    * take action: won't go anywhere without action. Reading is not action.
* Self acceptance, accept strength and weakness. OK to set ambitious goals,
  strive for excellence and take on challenges, but banish fear, shame dread and
  self-loathing.
* Authors' own experience supports change is possible, though not easy.
* Your life, your story, you can find context for your procrastination. Accept
  ourselves as we really are, rather than as we wish to be, then we are able to
  act in our best interest.

* 总结：25年之后的新版是因为各个研究领域的新进展能帮助更好的理解拖延症。社会的变化使得拖延更加
  容易发生。书的整体架构没有变：第一部分帮助大家理解拖延的原因，第二部分交给大家使用的技法克服
  拖延。当然最终要的还是需要读者身体力行，理解原因，实践技法。否则书就白读了。要认清真实的自己，
  然后接受自己，这样才能做出有针对性改变。

# Part 1

* The roots of procrastination can be deep and interweaving for somebody.
* One root: procrastinators use delay to avoid vulnerable feelings and fears. Know what you
  feel and understand why you feel it help one proceed.
* 2nd root: subjective time conflicts with clock time.
* biological roots: What you avoid and your brain structure affects each other, so biological
  tendacies don't have to impediation your progress.
* interpersonal root: Family, culture background.
* Learn from your experience, not deny, forget, judge but accept

# Ch01 Procrastination: nuisance or nemesis.

* New year's resolution: "I will never procrastinate again."
* Procrastination: forward to tomorrow, do it later. Samuel Johnson: "The folly
  of allowing ourselves to delay what we know cannot be finally escaped is one
  of the general weakness which, in spite of the instruction of moralist, and
  the remonstrances of reason, prevail to a greater or less degree in every mind."
* Procrastination has been on the rise and research doesn't have a simple answer.
* Has nothing to do with IQ but abates when people grows older.
* It plagues all people. Student/Self-employed/In company/In home

## How can I tell if I am procrastinating

* One way to tell: Weather it's a problem is whether you find troublesome.
* Some reason to put things off: low priority/want to think over/clarify options
* Some time, everything happens at once. People acknowledge that there are limits
  are unlikely to feel overly distressed.
* Some people don't suffer because the things are not important.
* Some people are overly confident so they don't suffer.

## Internal and external consequence

* Internal consequence: irritations/regret/self-condemnation/despair. Inside they
  feel miserable. Procrastination prevents them from doing all they think they
  are capable of.
* external consequences:
    * late payment
    * setbacks at school/work/relationship: divorce/lost of job

## The cycle of procrastination

* Procrastinators undergo a sequence of thoughts, feelings and behaviors, called
  Cycle of procrastination

1. "I will start early this time"
    * At the outset, very helpful. Believe start will somehow spontaneous occur.
      No planed effort.
2. "I've got start it soon"
    * Early start passed, anxiety and pressure builds up. But deadline is not yet
      in sight.
3. "What if I don't start"
    * "I should have started early": regret/lament
    * "I am doing everything but ..." avoid project but busy in other things.
      Distracting things even make you believe you made progress on the Project.
    * "I can't enjoy anything"
        * Try hard to enjoy yourself, the shadow of unfinished project looms.
      Any enjoyment rapidly disapprear replaced with guilty.
    * "I hope no one finds out"
        * Try to look busy even not working
        * illusion of progress even no first step
        * Avoid office/phone calls
        * Invent lies.
4. "There is still time"
    * Still hold on the hope.
5. "There is something with me"
    * Feel lack something: self-discipline, courage, brains.
6. To Do or Not to Do
    * Not: Flee or give up.
    * Do:
        1. "Can't wait any longer": so painful even worse than taking action
        2. "Isn't so bad, why didn't I just do it?"
        3. "Just get it done": No time to refine or improve
7. "I will never procrastinate again": Vow to start earlier next time until next time

## The roots of procrastination

* Procrastinators said: "everyone expects to perform perfect. Can't keep up with
  pressure". Success is defined in terms of perfect.
* It's not true, because not every one have trouble with procrastination.

### Earliest memories

* 2nd grade paper about mountain
* Won't do Mon telling me to do
* Dad won't let kid to go out play early, so kid daydream
* 5th grade, being made fun by classmates as teacher's pet.
* People still think of themselves in terms of label in school.
* People may think they have same learning issues in school, even though they
  have improved. So use procrastination to cover up.
* Once have, hard to stop.

### The Procrastinator's code

* The code, and do I have them as I know
  * I must be perfect. Y safer to procrastinate than work hard
  * Everything I do should go easily and without effort. Y
  * It’s safer to do nothing than to take a risk and fail. Y
  * I should have no limitations. Y
  * If it’s not done right, it’s not worth doing at all. Y
  * I must avoid being challenged. Y
  * If I succeed, someone will get hurt. N reducing your chances of doing well
  * If I do well this time, I must always do well. N
  * Following someone else’s rules means that I’m giving in and I’m not
  in control. Y only do it when you are ready
  * I can’t afford to let go of anything or anyone. Y
  * If I show my real self, people won’t like me. Y
  * There is a right answer, and I’ll wait until I find it. Y
* Self critical, apprehensive and catastrophic thoughts don't allow you to move
  beyond, but they are unrealistic thoughts.
* Procrastinator is afraid. And procrastination is the shield.
    * action to get them into trouble
    * show who they are will be dangerous

# Ch02 Fear of Failure

* Fear of failure: lacking, best efforts not enough. Procrastination is a strategy
  for coping with fear.

## Search for perfection

* David is academic star.
* He is worrying about being great and work very little.
* Procrastination helps facing a issue: terrified his best would be judged inadequate.
* They tend to define failure in broad way: failed on the task, failed as a person.
* For these people: self worth = ability = performance.
* I perform well, I have a lot of ability, I like myself. I don't perform well,
  I have no ability, I feel terrible.
* Outsanding performance = Outstanding person. mediocre performance = mediocre person.
* David thinks if he cannot make perfect brief, then he is a terrible person.
* Procrastination makes people believe they are brilliant and unlimited, don't
  have to confront their real limit.
* For some people, they would rather be blamed as disorganized than inadequate
  or unworthy. Procrastination eased the fear of failure. (中招)
* Some people fears if they are lacking, then they are unlovable.

## The world of a perfectionist

* Procrastinator are often perfectionist. Put unrealistic goals and feel overwhelmed
  and then retreat.
