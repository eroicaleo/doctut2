## 12 The law of religion

Today religion is considered as a source of discrimination, disagreement, disunion.
In fact, it's a third unifier of human kind.
All social orders are imaged, so they are fragile, the larger the society, the
more fragile it is.
The crucial historical role of religions give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structure.
Laws are not results of human caprice, but are ordained by absolute and supreme
authority. some basic laws are placed beyond challenge, thereby ensuring stable.

**Religion:** a system of norms and values that are founded on the belief in a
superhuman order.

Two criterion:

* There is a superhuman order. So football is not religion, because it's invented by human.
* Establish norms and values that it considers binding.

In order to unite a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of
people, religion needs to have two qualifications:

* Universal: the superhuman order is true always and everywhere.
* Missionary: insist on spreading the belief to everyone. 普渡众生。

A lot of religions are local and exclusive. Islam and Buddhism have all above 4
qualifications. So far as we know, these kind of religions appear in 1st millennium.

### Silencing the lambs

远古宗教以泛神论为主，农业革命削弱了泛神论，因为很多农作物和牲畜成了人类的附属品。问题在于人类还
是不能完全控制它们，比如让它们能够多产，免于传染病。所以这时候的神就被人类当成是和这些动植物沟通
的媒介，人类宣誓永远忠于这些神用以换取对这些动植物的控制权。随着王国和贸易网络的扩张，人类需要更
加强大的神，比如生育之神，雨神和战神。这就导致的多神教的产生。多神教和泛神论是共同存在的。多神教
的出现不仅把神的地位提升了，也把人类的地位提升了。从此人就高于了其余一切物种，成为了唯一能和神交
流的物种。

*我认为人类在交流中见到更多的东西，有了更多的见识，所以需要更加有普适性，更加抽象的神。*

Animism was the belief of hunter-gathers. So it doesn't have universal and missionary
property, because the hunter-gathers in Ganges valley sees different thing than
those in Indus valley.

Hunter-gathers are in the same status of plants and animals. But the agriculture
revolution is accompanied by religion revolution, because it turns the plant and
animal from equal members of spiritual into property.

Much of ancient mythology is like a legal contract in which human promise everlasting
devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals.

Then the kingdoms and trade networks expanded, people needed gods whose power and
authority encompassed a whole kingdom.
