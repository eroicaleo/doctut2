## 12 The law of religion

Today religion is considered as a source of discrimination, disagreement, disunion.
In fact, it's a third unifier of human kind.
All social orders are imaged, so they are fragile, the larger the society, the
more fragile it is.
The crucial historical role of religions give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structure.
Laws are not results of human caprice, but are ordained by absolute and supreme
authority. some basic laws are placed beyond challenge, thereby ensuring stable.

**Religion:** a system of norms and values that are founded on the belief in a
superhuman order.

Two criterion:

* There is a superhuman order. So football is not religion, because it's invented by human.
* Establish norms and values that it considers binding.

In order to unite a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of
people, religion needs to have two qualifications:

* Universal: the superhuman order is true always and everywhere.
* Missionary: insist on spreading the belief to everyone. 普渡众生。

A lot of religions are local and exclusive. Islam and Buddhism have all above 4
qualifications. So far as we know, these kind of religions appear in 1st millennium.

### Silencing the lambs

远古宗教以泛神论为主，农业革命削弱了泛神论，因为很多农作物和牲畜成了人类的附属品。问题在于人类还
是不能完全控制它们，比如让它们能够多产，免于传染病。所以这时候的神就被人类当成是和这些动植物沟通
的媒介，人类宣誓永远忠于这些神用以换取对这些动植物的控制权。随着王国和贸易网络的扩张，人类需要更
加强大的神，比如生育之神，雨神和战神。这就导致的多神教的产生。多神教和泛神论是共同存在的。多神教
的出现不仅把神的地位提升了，也把人类的地位提升了。从此人就高于了其余一切物种，成为了唯一能和神交
流的物种。

*我认为人类在交流中见到更多的东西，有了更多的见识，所以需要更加有普适性，更加抽象的神。*

Animism was the belief of hunter-gathers. So it doesn't have universal and missionary
property, because the hunter-gathers in Ganges valley sees different thing than
those in Indus valley.

Hunter-gathers are in the same status of plants and animals. But the agriculture
revolution is accompanied by religion revolution, because it turns the plant and
animal from equal members of spiritual into property.

Much of ancient mythology is like a legal contract in which human promise everlasting
devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals.

Then the kingdoms and trade networks expanded, people needed gods whose power and
authority encompassed a whole kingdom.

### The benefits of idolatry

现代人在一神教的长期洗脑之下（brainwashing)，总认为多神教是无知而幼稚（ignorant and childish）。
其实多神教并不反对说有一种更加supreme power 存在并且支配这这些神。希腊，北欧，阿兹台克，印度
多神体系中都有更高级的单一力量：fate, atman。

The fundamental difference is the supreme power is devoid of interest and biases
, it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of human.

所以大多数人不会想这些力量祷告，而会像smaller and partial power祈求。

多神教的一个意义深远的影响就是宗教宽容。It's inherently open-minded and rarely persecute
'heretics'.

Roman and Aztec empire doesn't require their subjects to change their religion.
They only ask them to respect the gods of the empire. The only religion the Roman
cannot tolerate is Christian, who refused to respect the Roman gods.

根据这本书，罗马帝国由皇帝直接发起的迫害只有4次。受到迫害的基督徒总数大概是几千人左右。但是之后的
一千五百多年中，基督教内部教派之间的相互迫害导致了数以百万计的基督徒死亡。例如，St. Bartholomew
day's massacre, 08/23/1572, estimated 5000 ~ 10000 protestants are killed by Catholics.

这本书简略地谈了 the difference between Catholics and Protestants.
Protestants: 只要信上帝就能进天堂。
Catholics: 还要attend church rituals and do good deeds.

### God is one

多神教导致了一神教的产生，因为有些教徒太喜欢某一个神。现今最早的多神教出现在大约公元前1350年的埃及。
有一个法老强迫大家只信一个神，但是随着他的死亡，很快就失败了。

犹太教是一神教，但是它却不具有universal and missionary的性质，因为他们相信上帝只关心犹太人以及
以色列这一块土地。直到:

Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power has bias and interests, and
if the He has bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross
for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about,
not just Jews. It was thus necessary to spread the good word - the gospel - about
Jesus throughout the world.

如果一神教承认别的教派的合法性，就等于说明自己的神不是supreme power of the universe.所以
过去的两千年一神教一直在用暴力消灭别的宗教。他们确实成功了。现在除了东亚之外的绝大部分地区，人们
总是信仰一种一神教。并且global political order is built on monotheistic foundation.

在基督教中，多神教以一种新的方式继续存在。就像朱庇特是罗马的守护神，St George for England,
St Andrew for Scotland, St Stephen for Hungary and St Martin for France.
St Ambrose for Milan, St Mark for Venice.
St Florian for chimney cleaning, St Mathew for tax collection.

理论和现实的差距总是很大的。
神学理论：因为supreme power无所不能，所以不需要求助于次级的神。
人们现实心里是大神距离太远，没有办法帮助实现现实的需求，因而要求助次级的神。

### The battle of Good and Evil

二神教较之于一神教的优势在于它可以解释世间为什会有邪恶，灾难，痛苦。

The drawback is it's hard to explain "The problem of order": God creates the law
of physics, but in the world
of dualism, who creates the law that Good and evil that must obey.

One famous dualistic religion is Zoroaster.

一神教对于二神教的吸收：The powerful evil force. The body and soul, the matter and
spirit.

总结: The monotheism is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist, animist.
The average Christian believes in monotheist God, dualist evil, polytheist saints
and animist ghost.

### The Law of Nature

东方的儒释道皆属于这样的宗教，西方的犬儒主义，斯多克主义皆属于这个范畴。

其特点是认为万事万物都受到自然法则的约束。有强大的神的存在，但是他们也无法脱离自然法则。

重点阐述佛教。释迦摩尼参透了人世间的痛苦并不是来自外部世界，而是源于内心的贪婪与欲望（craving）。
释迦摩尼的解决办法是训练一种冥想（meditation）方法，让人把思想放在经历上，而不是欲望上。
What am I experiencing now rather than what would I rather be experiencing.

作者概括的佛教的核心价值：suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully
liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way
to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.

能够达到这个目标的人就叫做涅槃（nirvana）。

### Worship of man

Unity: This section presents several 20th century religions, communism, nationalism,
capitalism, liberalism, and introduces communism and humanity in detail.

Outline

* Compare the communism with other old religion
    * Buddhism: law of nature was discovered by Siddharth Gautama, Communism: it's
      discovered by Karl Marx.
    * Has holy scripts: Das Kapital, which foretold the history
    * Has holiday and festival
    * Has "theologians" and "Chaplain" ("Commissar")
    * Has martyrs, hold wars and heretics ("Trotskyism")
    * Fanatical and missionary
* Presents three humanity: homo sapiens has a unique and sacred nature endowed
by the creator which is fundamentally different from other nature beings. The
supreme good is the good of humanity.
    * Liberalism: humanity resides in each individual human, the commandment is
      to protect the freedom of each homo sapiens.
    * Socialism: humanity resides within the species of homo sapiens, commandment
      is to protect equality with the species.
    * Evolutionary, e.g. Nazi, might degenerate or evolve, commandment is to protect
      from degenerating.

点评：作为一个犹太人，能够对Nazi进行如此冷静客观的分析，令人敬佩。

## 13 The secret of success

### The hindsight fallacy

Unity: History is chaotic, not deterministic and not predictable. It's easy to
explain how a series of particular events happens, but it's difficult to explain
why this specific possibility is realized but not others.

Outline:

* Example on "how" and "why" Christian took over Roman empire. We can guess the
  reason of Emperor Constantine's conversion, but it's impossible to know the
  exact reason.
* Definition of "how" and "why" an event happens.
  * "how": means reconstruct the series of specific events that led from one point
    to another
  * "why": means find the causal connection that account for the occurrence of
    particular series of events to the exclusion of other possibilities.
* Criticize the "deterministic" historians and point out the iron law of history
  * geological, genetic or economic force only adds constraints, it's like constraints
    in an optimization problem or necessary conditions, but it's not sufficient
    conditions.
  * It's the iron law of history that what is inevitable in hindsight is far more
    obvious at that time.
* possibilities seem unlikely to contemporaries often get realized.
  * Christian in 306 when Constantine assumes throne, esoteric Eastern sect,
    becomes Roman state religion
  * Bolsheviks in 1913, small radical faction, took Russian 4 yr later
  * Islam in 600 AD, a small band of desert-dwelling Arabs.
* History is "level 2" chaotic system, the dynamics respond to the prediction.
  "level 1" system is like weather. Examples are like:
  * Stock market
  * 1989 Soviet revolution, Arab spring.
* Why we need to study history. Not to know the future but to broad our horizon,
  So we know our current situation is neither nature nor inevitable. It can have
  many possibilities.

Term: hindsight

点评："how"不就是太史公所说的：王迹所兴，源始查终，见圣观衰。这里说的偶然性，不就是太史公说的
天人之际。历史不能完全由人决定。但是人事可以排除掉一些可能性，所以要尽人事，听天命。

### Blind Clio

Unity: History's decision is not made for the benefit of human. Culture idea is
more like virus, replicating itself unconsciously.

Outline:

* There is absolutely no evidence that human well-being inevitably improve as the
  history rolls along. There is no objective scale to measure the benefit.
    * Examples, Christian is not good for people who doesn't take Christian idea.
    * Same thing for Islam.
* Culture idea is like parasites or virus, live inside the minds of humans. They
  multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening or killing
  the hosts.
    * Like communism, can compel people to dedicate his life to spread the idea,
      even at the price of his life.
* Memetics, culture evolution is based on the replicating of the basic culture
  unit called memes. The successful cultures are those who excel in replicating
  their memes, irrespective of the costs and benefits to their human hosts.
* Similar idea is in postmodernism
    * Nationalism is like plague, one country is infected by it, neighboring
      countries are also likely to catch the virus. It causes war, oppression,
      hate and genocide.
* Also in social science, game theory explains why decision that harm all players
  can take root and spread.
    * example is arm races, billions of dollars are wasted, which could have been
      invested in education and health.
    * The arm race idea doesn't seek to survive or reproduce, but it's an unintended
      results of powerful dynamics.

点评： 这就好像是我们经常说的“文化的传承”。这样看来，儒家文化还是一种蛮成功的文化。

## 14 The discover of Ignorance

从衣食住行的角度介绍了科学革命给人类社会带来的巨变:
* 登月(July/20/1969)是一向evolutionary and cosmic feat.
* 试爆原子弹成功(July/16/1946)让人类有了end history的能力。

Before 1500, government and wealthy patrons allocated funds to education and
scholarship, the aim was to preserve existing capabilities rather than acquire
new one.

After 1500,
People increasingly come to believe that they can increase their abilities by
investing in scientific research. It's not blind faith,
it has been repeatedly proven empirically.

science -> power -> resource -> science loop.

### Ignoramus

Outline:

Modern science is different from all previous tradition of knowledge in 3 critical
ways:

* Willingness to admit ignorance: Assume we don't know everything. Even more critically,
  things we think we know can be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No
  concept, idea or knowledge is sacred and beyond challenge.
* Gather observations and use mathematical tools to connect observations together
  to form comprehensive theories.
* Not only to create theories, but to acquire new power and develop new technologies.

*The scientific revolution is not a revolution of knowledge but a revolution of
ignorance.*

Premodern traditions of knowledge about knowledge: Gods or ancient wise people
has revealed us in the holy scripts or oral conversation.

Premodern traditions of knowledge about ignorance:

1. An individual can be ignorance, he just needs to ask wiser people.
2. entire tradition can be ignorant of *unimportant* things, e.g. how spider weave
  webs. This kind of knowledge is a little more than trivia, and with no bearing
  on the fundamental truths of society, politics and economy.
3. People who argued they found the important thing were marginalized or persecuted,
  or they founded another tradition and began arguing that they knew everything.

Modern science about ignorance: it's unique because it openly admits collective
ignorance regarding to the most important questions.

1. Darwin didn't claim he had solved the riddle of life once and for all. Biologists
  admit they don't know how brain works. Physicists don't know how to reconcile
  Relativity and Quantum mechanics.
2. Debate theories based on new evidence: economy.
3. Even a theory is consistent with available evidence, everyone agrees it has to
  be revised or rejected with new contradictory evidence.

The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic, inquisitive
and supple than any previous traditions of knowledge. This has hugely expanded
our capacity to understand the world and our ability to invent new technologies.
But it also presents us with a serious problem that most of our ancestors don't
have to cope with. The assumption that we don't know everything and even the knowledge
we process is tentative, extends to the shared myth that enable millions of strangers
to cooperate effectively. If the evidence shows that many of those myths doubtful,
how can we hold society together? How can our communities, countries and international
system function?

Two approaches:

* Communism and Nazi, take one scientific theory and declares it's final and absolute truth.
* Liberal humanism, live with a non-scientific theory, which is built on a dogmatic
  belief in the unique worth and rights of human beings.

点评：人类进步的过程从认识自己的无知开始，个人的进步不也是从认识到自我的无知开始吗?
前文提到史前人类的大脑和现代人的没有区别，那么这个时候开始科学革命又是为什么呢？前文又提到如果
没有偶然性，可能又会过几百年再开始科学革命。

做一件事要成功得有第一正确的态度，第二要有正确的方法，第三最好还要有实用行。

### Science dogma

Unity: The modern science research method is based on collecting empirical observations
and connecting them into comprehensive theory with the help of mathematical tools.

Outline:

Modern research methods have two components:
1. obtain new observations
2. connect observations with mathematical tools
Traditional knowledge laid down their theories with stories and narrative forms.

Excerpt:
Modern science has no dogma. Yet it has a common core of research methods, which
are all based on collecting empirical observations, those we can observe with
at least one of our senses - and putting them together with the help of mathematical
tools.

As modern people came to admit that they don't know the answers to some very
important questions, they found it necessary to look for completely new knowledge.
Consequently, the dominate modern research methods take for grant the insufficiency
of old knowledge. Instead of studying old traditions, emphasis is now placed on
new observations and experiments. When present observation collides with past
tradition, we give precedence to the observation. ... But from their first year
in college, aspiring physicists, archaeologist and political scientists are taught
that it's their mission to go beyond what Einstein, Heinrich Schliemann and Max
Weber ever know.

Mere observations, however, are not knowledge. In order to understand the universe,
we need to connect observations into comprehensive theories. Earlier traditions
usually formulated their theories in terms of stories. Modern science uses mathematics.

When traditional mythologies and scriptures laid down general laws, these were
presented in narrative rather than mathematical form.

### Knowledge is power

Paragraph Summary:

* Knowledge is hard to understand
    * mathematical language and contradict to common sense.
* Knowledge gives us new power, enjoys immense prestige. Everyone understand this.

* 1620 Francis Bacon's science manifesto: "Knowledge is power".
    * Truth is poor test, no knowledge is 100% true.
    * Utility is good test. Theory empowers us, makes us to do new things constitutes
      knowledge.

* connection between science & technology is so strong to separate them TODAY.
    * No science research, no new technology.
    * Don't result in new technology, little point to do research.

* relationship between the 2
    * <1500, totally separate.
    * 1600, revolutionary.
    * 1700, tightened.
    * early 1800, still don't finance research.
    * late 1800, tied.

* In world war II
    * Germany scientists was developing V-2 rocket and jet-powered aircraft which
      gave soliders and civilians hope even defeat is imminent and Allies were
      closing in.
    * American Manhattan project developed atomic bomb and Japan surrendered
      unconditionally

* military revolution is the product of organizational (past) rather than
  technological changes (now).
    * No empire rises thanks to technological wizardry
    * No rulers thought to enlarge technological gap
    * Vanquished empires often enjoys superior military/civilian tech.

* Roman empire army
    * advantage rested on efficient organization, iron discipline, huge manpower
      reserve
    * technologically, no edge over carthage, Macedonia.
    * No research and development department.
    * Scipio Aemilianus would have a fair chance of beating Constantine 500 yr
      later.
    * Napoleon is a brilliant tactician, but can fight against a modern army

* Chinese empire
    * Most important military invention is gunpowder.
    * Only used in firecrackers.
    * No medieval Manhattan Project even Song empire collapsed in the Mongol invasion.
    * Reason: No one thinks gunpowder would save them or make them rich.

* Logistic and strategy continued to have far greater impact.
    * Even Napoleon, Himself artillery man, had little interest in new weapons.
* The advent of capitalism system and Industrial revolution, intertwined Science
  Industry and military technology together.

Comments:

套用《明朝那些事儿》拿破仑一个优秀的战术实施者，一个坚定的战斗执行者，但他并不是一个卓越的战略制定者。

### Idea of progress

Paragraph Summary:

* Past cultures didn't believe in progress
    * Golden age exists in the past
    * Current world is stagnant or deteriorating
    * Their reason: if Jesus/Confucius/... can't abolish famine/disease/poverty/war,
      how could we do.

* Ancient myths: discover new knowledge/invent new tools/attempt to go beyond human limitation
    * ludicrous + hubris
    * inevitable lead to disappointment and disaster

* Modern culture:
    * marriage of two ideas made people believe real progress might be possible
        1. admission of ignorance
        2. scientific discoveries could give new power
    * famine/disease/poverty/war was not the fate but the fruits of ignorance.

* Lightning example

* poverty example
    * past: always have poverty
    * modern: amenable to intervention and can be eliminated
    * social poverty: withhold from some people the opportunities available to
      others.

### The Gilgamesh Project

Paragraph Summary:

* Death: most vexing/interesting/important questions
    * Past faiths:
        1. inevitable fate
        2. death gives life meaning, hopes are on the afterlife
        3. best minds are giving death meaning, not trying to escape/overcome death
        4. Gilgamesh the most ancient myths: God set death as man's inevitable
           destiny and man must learn to live with it.
    * Modern men of science
        1. Death is a technical problem, and needs technical solution
            * heart attack/cancer/bacteria, 头疼医头，脚疼医脚
        2. We don't have solutions for all problems, but best minds are working
           on them.
    * We can be frank about defeating death now. Even still distant, but we have
      achieved things inconceivable several centuries ago.
        * Richard Lionheart died infection, which is simple today
        * In those days, the only way is amputation and no anesthetics.
* Facts about improving in human health.
    * Average human life jumped from 25 to 67
    * Child mortality: 1/4-1/3 died before adulthood in agriculture.
        * England, 15% die < 1yr, 1/3 die < 15yr in 17 century. 0.5% die < 1yr,
          0.7% dir < 15yr nowadays.
    * Edward I's Wife Queen Eleanor, 30yr gave birth to 16 children. Last one is Edward II.
      6 live beyond 11yr, only 3 live beyond 40.
    * Nano-robots open blocked blood vessels, fight viruses.
* Religions and ideologies
    * pre-18 century, death and aftermath central to the meaning of life.
    * post-18 century, Communist/Capitalist/Feminist all lost interest in the afterlife.

### The Sugar Daddy (干爹) of Science

Unity:
Ideologies justify the funding for science research and determines science agenda
  and what to do with discoveries. It also shaped all science today.

Paragraph Summary:

* Science is shaped by religion/politics/economics.
* Science research costs money, biology/archaeology/economics examples.
* If no Darwin, another person (Wallace) will eventually make the same discovery.
  But if no money, it can never happen.
* Government and business spends money on science research because they believe
  the investment can help them attain certain political/economic/religion goals.
    * 16th century, money went to expedition but not children psychology.
    * mid 20th century, money went to nuclear projects rather than some archaeology.
* Not scientists but money dictates the science agenda.
    * resource is limited, the allocation depends on "what is important/good?"
      question, which can be only answered by religions/ideologies.
    * biology, cow example, udder disease V.S. mental health.
        * scientifically equally interesting
        * diary Industry benefits from udder disease research more and they have
          more political/economic clout.
        * mental health research proposal must appeal to value commercial potential
          of milk and health of human over cows.
* Science cannot decide what is important and what to do with the discovery:
    * Genetic knowledge to cure cancer or build superhuman? Liberal and Nazi
      Government might have different answers.
* Ideologies justify the funding for science research and determines science agenda
  and what to do with discoveries. It also shaped all science today.
* Two forces will be discussed in detail: imperialism and capitalism.

## 15 The marriage of empire and science

The story of 1769 expedition, the good part:
    * Venus transit, Astronomer Charles Green, Botanists Joesph Banks.
    * enormous quantities of data
    * James Cook verify vitamin c can cure scurvy
the bad part:
    * claimed islands for Britain.
    * Laid foundation for occupation/conquest/settlement/extermination

Proposition:
Science expedition protected by military forces? military expedition with a few
scientist? Half full/empty tank, both are true. scientific revolution and modern
imperialism are inseparable.
