## 12 The law of religion

Today religion is considered as a source of discrimination, disagreement, disunion.
In fact, it's a third unifier of human kind.
All social orders are imaged, so they are fragile, the larger the society, the
more fragile it is.
The crucial historical role of religions give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structure.
Laws are not results of human caprice, but are ordained by absolute and supreme
authority. some basic laws are placed beyond challenge, thereby ensuring stable.

**Religion:** a system of norms and values that are founded on the belief in a
superhuman order.

Two criterion:

* There is a superhuman order. So football is not religion, because it's invented by human.
* Establish norms and values that it considers binding.

In order to unite a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of
people, religion needs to have two qualifications:

* Universal: the superhuman order is true always and everywhere.
* Missionary: insist on spreading the belief to everyone. 普渡众生。

A lot of religions are local and exclusive. Islam and Buddhism have all above 4
qualifications. So far as we know, these kind of religions appear in 1st millennium.

### Silencing the lambs

远古宗教以泛神论为主，农业革命削弱了泛神论，因为很多农作物和牲畜成了人类的附属品。问题在于人类还
是不能完全控制它们，比如让它们能够多产，免于传染病。所以这时候的神就被人类当成是和这些动植物沟通
的媒介，人类宣誓永远忠于这些神用以换取对这些动植物的控制权。随着王国和贸易网络的扩张，人类需要更
加强大的神，比如生育之神，雨神和战神。这就导致的多神教的产生。多神教和泛神论是共同存在的。多神教
的出现不仅把神的地位提升了，也把人类的地位提升了。从此人就高于了其余一切物种，成为了唯一能和神交
流的物种。

*我认为人类在交流中见到更多的东西，有了更多的见识，所以需要更加有普适性，更加抽象的神。*

Animism was the belief of hunter-gathers. So it doesn't have universal and missionary
property, because the hunter-gathers in Ganges valley sees different thing than
those in Indus valley.

Hunter-gathers are in the same status of plants and animals. But the agriculture
revolution is accompanied by religion revolution, because it turns the plant and
animal from equal members of spiritual into property.

Much of ancient mythology is like a legal contract in which human promise everlasting
devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals.

Then the kingdoms and trade networks expanded, people needed gods whose power and
authority encompassed a whole kingdom.

### The benefits of idolatry

现代人在一神教的长期洗脑之下（brainwashing)，总认为多神教是无知而幼稚（ignorant and childish）。
其实多神教并不反对说有一种更加supreme power 存在并且支配这这些神。希腊，北欧，阿兹台克，印度
多神体系中都有更高级的单一力量：fate, atman。

The fundamental difference is the supreme power is devoid of interest and biases
, it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of human.

所以大多数人不会想这些力量祷告，而会像smaller and partial power祈求。

多神教的一个意义深远的影响就是宗教宽容。It's inherently open-minded and rarely persecute
'heretics'.

Roman and Aztec empire doesn't require their subjects to change their religion.
They only ask them to respect the gods of the empire. The only religion the Roman
cannot tolerate is Christian, who refused to respect the Roman gods.

根据这本书，罗马帝国由皇帝直接发起的迫害只有4次。受到迫害的基督徒总数大概是几千人左右。但是之后的
一千五百多年中，基督教内部教派之间的相互迫害导致了数以百万计的基督徒死亡。例如，St. Bartholomew
day's massacre, 08/23/1572, estimated 5000 ~ 10000 protestants are killed by Catholics.

这本书简略地谈了 the difference between Catholics and Protestants.
Protestants: 只要信上帝就能进天堂。
Catholics: 还要attend church rituals and do good deeds.

### God is one

多神教导致了一神教的产生，因为有些教徒太喜欢某一个神。现今最早的多神教出现在大约公元前1350年的埃及。
有一个法老强迫大家只信一个神，但是随着他的死亡，很快就失败了。

犹太教是一神教，但是它却不具有universal and missionary的性质，因为他们相信上帝只关心犹太人以及
以色列这一块土地。直到:

Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power has bias and interests, and
if the He has bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross
for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about,
not just Jews. It was thus necessary to spread the good word - the gospel - about
Jesus throughout the world.

如果一神教承认别的教派的合法性，就等于说明自己的神不是supreme power of the universe.所以
过去的两千年一神教一直在用暴力消灭别的宗教。他们确实成功了。现在除了东亚之外的绝大部分地区，人们
总是信仰一种一神教。并且global political order is built on monotheistic foundation.

在基督教中，多神教以一种新的方式继续存在。就像朱庇特是罗马的守护神，St George for England,
St Andrew for Scotland, St Stephen for Hungary and St Martin for France.
St Ambrose for Milan, St Mark for Venice.
St Florian for chimney cleaning, St Mathew for tax collection.

理论和现实的差距总是很大的。
神学理论：因为supreme power无所不能，所以不需要求助于次级的神。
人们现实心里是大神距离太远，没有办法帮助实现现实的需求，因而要求助次级的神。

### The battle of Good and Evil

二神教较之于一神教的优势在于它可以解释世间为什会有邪恶，灾难，痛苦。

The drawback is it's hard to explain "The problem of order": God creates the law
of physics, but in the world
of dualism, who creates the law that Good and evil that must obey.

One famous dualistic religion is Zoroaster.

一神教对于二神教的吸收：The powerful evil force. The body and soul, the matter and
spirit.

总结: The monotheism is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist, animist.
The average Christian believes in monotheist God, dualist evil, polytheist saints
and animist ghost.

### The Law of Nature

东方的儒释道皆属于这样的宗教，西方的犬儒主义，斯多克主义皆属于这个范畴。

其特点是认为万事万物都受到自然法则的约束。有强大的神的存在，但是他们也无法脱离自然法则。

重点阐述佛教。释迦摩尼参透了人世间的痛苦并不是来自外部世界，而是源于内心的贪婪与欲望（craving）。
释迦摩尼的解决办法是训练一种冥想（meditation）方法，让人把思想放在经历上，而不是欲望上。
What am I experiencing now rather than what would I rather be experiencing.

作者概括的佛教的核心价值：suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully
liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way
to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.

能够达到这个目标的人就叫做涅槃（nirvana）。
