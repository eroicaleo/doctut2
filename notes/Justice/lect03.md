When we finished last time,
we were looking at John Stuart Mill's
attempt to reply to the critics of Bentham's Utilitarianism.
In his book Utilitarianism, Mill tries to show, that critics
to the contrary, it is possible within the utilitarian framework
to distinguish between higher and lower pleasures.
It is possible to make qualitative distinctions of worth and we tested
that idea with the Simpsons and the Shakespeare excerpts.
And the results of our experiment seem to call into question
Mill's distinction because a great many of you reported that you prefer

the Simpsons but that you still consider Shakespeare to be
the higher or the worthier pleasure.
That's the dilemma with which our experiment confronts Mill.
What about Mill's attempt to account for the especially weighty character
of individual rights and justice in chapter five of Utilitarianism.
He wants to say that individual rights are worthy of special respect.
In fact, he goes so far as to say that justice is
the most sacred part and the most incomparably binding part
of morality.
But the same challenge could be put to this part of Mill's defense.
Why is justice the chief part and the most binding part of our morality?

Well, he says because in the long run,
if we do justice and if we respect rights,
society as a whole will be better off in the long run.
Well, what about that?
What if we have a case where making an exception and
violating individual rights actually will make people better off
in the long run?
Is it all right then to use people?
And there is a further objection that could be raised
against Mill's case for justice and rights.
Suppose the utilitarian calculus in the long run
works out as he says it will such that respecting people's rights
is a way of making everybody better off in the long run.
Is that the right reason?
Is that the only reason to respect people?
If the doctor goes in and yanks the organs from
the healthy patient who came in for a checkup
to save five lives,
there would be adverse effects in the long run.
