When we finished last time,
we were looking at John Stuart Mill's
attempt to reply to the critics of Bentham's Utilitarianism.
In his book Utilitarianism, Mill tries to show, that critics
to the contrary, it is possible within the utilitarian framework
to distinguish between higher and lower pleasures.
It is possible to make qualitative distinctions of worth and we tested
that idea with the Simpsons and the Shakespeare excerpts.
And the results of our experiment seem to call into question
Mill's distinction because a great many of you reported that you prefer

the Simpsons but that you still consider Shakespeare to be
the higher or the worthier pleasure.
That's the dilemma with which our experiment confronts Mill.
What about Mill's attempt to account for the especially weighty character
of individual rights and justice in chapter five of Utilitarianism.
He wants to say that individual rights are worthy of special respect.
In fact, he goes so far as to say that justice is
the most sacred part and the most incomparably binding part
of morality.
But the same challenge could be put to this part of Mill's defense.
Why is justice the chief part and the most binding part of our morality?
