When we finished last time,
we were looking at John Stuart Mill's
attempt to reply to the critics of Bentham's Utilitarianism.
In his book Utilitarianism, Mill tries to show, that critics
to the contrary, it is possible within the utilitarian framework
to distinguish between higher and lower pleasures.
It is possible to make qualitative distinctions of worth and we tested
that idea with the Simpsons and the Shakespeare excerpts.
And the results of our experiment seem to call into question
Mill's distinction because a great many of you reported that you prefer

the Simpsons but that you still consider Shakespeare to be
the higher or the worthier pleasure.
That's the dilemma with which our experiment confronts Mill.
What about Mill's attempt to account for the especially weighty character
of individual rights and justice in chapter five of Utilitarianism.
He wants to say that individual rights are worthy of special respect.
In fact, he goes so far as to say that justice is
the most sacred part and the most incomparably binding part
of morality.
But the same challenge could be put to this part of Mill's defense.
Why is justice the chief part and the most binding part of our morality?

2:32
Well, he says because in the long run,
if we do justice and if we respect rights,
society as a whole will be better off in the long run.
Well, what about that?
What if we have a case where making an exception and
violating individual rights actually will make people better off
in the long run?
Is it all right then to use people?
And there is a further objection that could be raised
against Mill's case for justice and rights.
Suppose the utilitarian calculus in the long run
works out as he says it will such that respecting people's rights
is a way of making everybody better off in the long run.
Is that the right reason,
Is that the only reason to respect people?

3:28
If the doctor goes in and yanks the organs from
the healthy patient who came in for a checkup
to save five lives,
there would be adverse effects in the long run.
eventually people would learn about this, and would stop going in for checkups.
Is it the right reason, is it the only reason that you, as a doctor, won't yank
the organs out of a healthy patient? That you think, well, if I use him in this
way, in the long run, more lives will be lost? or is there another reason having
to do with intrinsic respect for the person as an individual? And if that reason
matters, and it's not so clear, that even Mill's Utilitarianism can take account
of it. Fully to examine these two worries or objections to Mill's defense, we need
to push further.

4:35
We need to ask in the case of higher or worthier pleasures, are there theories
of good life that can provide independent moral standards for the worth of
pleasures? If so what do they look like? That's one question.
In the case of justice and rights, if we suspect that Mill is implicitly leaning
on notions of human dignity or respect for persons that are not, strictly speaking,
utilitarian, we need to look to see whether there are some stronger theories of
rights that can explain the intuition, which even Mill shares, the intuition that
the reason for respecting individuals and not using them goes beyond,
even utility in the long run.

5:37
Today we turn to one of those theories of rights. Strong theories of rights say
individuals matter not just as instruments to be used for a larger social purpose
or for the sake of maximizing utility. Individuals are separate beings with separate
lives worthy of respect and so it's a mistake, according to strong theory of rights,
it's a mistake to think about justice or law by just adding up preferences and values.
The strong theory of rights we turn to today is libertarianism.
Libertarianism takes individual rights seriously. It's called libertarianism because
it says the fundamental individual right is the right to liberty.

6:40
Precisely
because we are separate individual beings, we are not available to any use that
the society might desire or device. Precisely because we are individual separate
human beings, we have a fundamental right to liberty and that means a right to
choose freely, to live our lives as we please, provided we respect other people's
rights to do the same. That's the fundamental idea. Robert Nozick, one of the
libertarian philosophers we read, for this course puts it this way, individuals
have right, so strong and far-reaching are these rights that they raise the question
of what, if anything, the state may do.
