# Chapter 1

## Consistency, Completeness, Hilbert's Program

* For principia Mathematica, no one was sure if 1) all of mathematics really
  was contained in the methods delineated by Russell and Whitehead, or 2)
  the methods given were even self-consistent.
* David Hilbert's Challenge: to demonstrate rigorously - perhaps following the
  very methods outlined by Russell and Whitehead - that the system defined in
  Principia Mathematica was both consistent (contradiction free) and complete
  (that every true statement of number theory could be derived within the
  framework drawn up in P.M.).
* Godel's paper revealed not only that there were irreparable "holes" in the
  axiomatic system proposed by R&W, but more generally, that no axiomatic
  system whatsoever could produce all number-theoretical truths, unless it were
  an inconsistent system! And finally, the hope of proving the consistency of
  a system such as that presented in P.M. was shown to be vain: if such a proof
  could be found using only methods inside P.M., then - and this is one of the
  most mystifying consequences of Godel's work - P.M. itself would be inconsistent.

## Babbage, Computer, AI

* Charles Babbage's analytic engine was to possess both a store and a mill.
  He had a vision of numbers swirling in and out under the control of a program
  contained in punched cards - an idea inspired by Jacquard loom.
* Lady Lovelace was profoundly aware with the invention of AE, mankind was
  flirting with mechanized intelligence - particularly if the AE were capable of
  changing its own stored program.
  Lady Lovelace was skeptical about the artificial creation of intelligence.
  "The analytic engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It
  can do whatever we know how to order it to perform."
* In theory, Alan Turing proved counterparts of Godel's theorem. But in practice,
  real computers power grow and grow beyond their maker's power of prophecy.
* Essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:
    * respond to situations very flexible.
    * to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances.
    * to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages.
    * to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation.
    * to find similarities between situations despite difference which may
      separate them.
    * to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may
      link them.
    * to synthesis new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together
      in new ways.
    * to come up new ideas which are novel.
* Here one runs up against a seeming paradox. Computers by their very nature
  are the most inflexible, desire-less, rule-following of beasts. Fast though
  they maybe, they are nonetheless the epitome of unconsciousness. Then how can
  intelligent behavior be programed? Isn't this the most blatant of contradiction
  in terms? One of the major theses of this book is that this is not a contradiction
  at all. One of the major purposes of this book is to urge readers to confront
  the apparent contradiction head to, so in the end the readers might emerge
  new insights into the seemingly unbreachable gulf between formal and informal,
  animate and inanimate, flexible and inflexible.
* The strange flavor of AI work is that people tries to put together a long set
  of rules in strict formalism which tells inflexible machines how to be flexible.
* What sorts of rules that could possibly capture all of what we think of as
  intelligent behavior, however? Certainly there must be rules on all sorts of
  different levels. "just plain" rules/meta rules to modify "just plain" rules/
  metameta rules to modify meta rules. The flexibility of intelligence comes from
  the enormous number of different rules, and levels of rules. The reason that
  so many rules on so many different levels must exist is that in life, a creature
  is faced with millions of situations of completely different types. In some
  situations, there are stereotyped responses which require "just plain" rules.
  Some situations are mixtures of stereotyped responses - they require rules for
  deciding which of the "just plain" rules to apply. Some situations cannot be
  classified - thus there must exist rules inventing new rules. Without doubt,
  Strange loop involving rules that can change themselves, directly or indirectly,
  are at the core of intelligence. Sometimes the complexity of our mind seems
  so overwhelming that One feels that there can be no answer to the question
  of understanding the intelligence - that it is wrong to think that rules of
  any sort govern a creature's behavior.
