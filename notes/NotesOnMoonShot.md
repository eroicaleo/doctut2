High above there is the Moon, cold and quite,
no air, no life, but glowing in the sky.

Here below, there are three men, who close themselves in special clothes, who
click lock hands in heavy gloves, who click-lock heads in large, round helmets.

It's summer here in Florida, hot, and near the sea. But now these men are dressed
for colder, stranger places. They walk with stiff and awkward steps in suits not
made for Earth.

They have studied and practiced and trained, and said good-bye to family and friends.
If all goes well, they will be gone for one week, gone where no one has been.

Their two small spaceships are *Columbia* and *Eagle*. They sit atop the rocket that
will raise them into space, a monster of a machine: It stands thirty stories, it
weights six million pounds, a tower full of fuel and fire and valves and pipes
and engines, too big to believe, but built to fly - the mighty, massive Saturn V.

The astronauts squeeze in to *Columbia*'s sideways seats, lying on their backs,
facing toward the sky - Neil Armstrong on the left, Michael Collins on the right,
Buzz Aldrin in the middle.

*Click* and they fasten the straps. *Click* and the hatch is sealed.

There they wait, while the Saturn hums beneath them.

Near the rocket, in Launch Control, and far away in Houston, in Mission Control,
there are numbers, screens, and charts, ways of watching an checking every piece
of the rocket and ships, the fuel, the valves, the pipes, the engines, and the
beats of the astronauts' hearts.

As the countdown closes, each man watching is asked the question: "GO/NO GO?" And
each man watching answers back: "GO." "GO." "GO." Apollo 11 is GO for launch.

10 ... 9 8 7. Ignition sequence started. Flames push hard against the pad, every
second pushing harder. 6 5 4. But still the rocket does not rise. Might arms hold
it steady ... hold it till the countdown's finish. 3, 2, 1, ZERO.

点火序列开始了。火焰重重地推着地面，一秒一秒越推越有力。6，5，4，但是火箭还是岿然不动。巨大的机械
手臂稳稳地扶着它，一直要扶到倒数结束。

LIFTOFF! The rocket is released! It rises foot by foot, it rises pound by pound.

It climbs the summer sky. It rides a flapping cracking flame and shakes the air,
and shakes the earth, and makes a mighty **ROAR**.

Armstrong, Collins, Aldrin ride the fire and thunder pressed deep in their seats,
their bodies as heavy as clay. The rocket below them sheds parts as it soars. Bolts
explode, engines ignite - first stage, second stage, escape tower - gone. The
rocket flies lighter, the rocket flies faster; in twelve minutes' time, it's one
hundred miles high. Then, after an orbit around the Earth to talk with Mission
Control, to check the course, to check the rocket and ships, the rocket's last
stage fires again, pushing the astronauts on.
