High above there is the Moon, cold and quite,
no air, no life, but glowing in the sky.

一轮清冷明月挂在空中，没有空气，没有生命，但却在空中闪耀。

Here below, there are three men, who close themselves in special clothes, who
click lock hands in heavy gloves, who click-lock heads in large, round helmets.

在地球上，有三个宇航员正在穿着特制的宇航服。

It's summer here in Florida, hot, and near the sea. But now these men are dressed
for colder, stranger places. They walk with stiff and awkward steps in suits not
made for Earth.

They have studied and practiced and trained, and said good-bye to family and friends.
If all goes well, they will be gone for one week, gone where no one has been.

Their two small spaceships are *Columbia* and *Eagle*. They sit atop the rocket that
will raise them into space, a monster of a machine: It stands thirty stories, it
weights six million pounds, a tower full of fuel and fire and valves and pipes
and engines, too big to believe, but built to fly - the mighty, massive Saturn V.

The astronauts squeeze in to *Columbia*'s sideways seats, lying on their backs,
facing toward the sky - Neil Armstrong on the left, Michael Collins on the right,
Buzz Aldrin in the middle.

*Click* and they fasten the straps. *Click* and the hatch is sealed.

There they wait, while the Saturn hums beneath them.

Near the rocket, in Launch Control, and far away in Houston, in Mission Control,
there are numbers, screens, and charts, ways of watching an checking every piece
of the rocket and ships, the fuel, the valves, the pipes, the engines, and the
beats of the astronauts' hearts.

As the countdown closes, each man watching is asked the question: "GO/NO GO?" And
each man watching answers back: "GO." "GO." "GO." Apollo 11 is GO for launch.

10 ... 9 8 7. Ignition sequence started. Flames push hard against the pad, every
second pushing harder. 6 5 4. But still the rocket does not rise. Might arms hold
it steady ... hold it till the countdown's finish. 3, 2, 1, ZERO.

点火序列开始了。火焰重重地推着地面，一秒一秒越推越有力。6，5，4，但是火箭还是岿然不动。巨大的机械
手臂稳稳地扶着它，一直要扶到倒数结束。


LIFTOFF! The rocket is released! It rises foot by foot, it rises pound by pound.

It climbs the summer sky. It rides a flapping cracking flame and shakes the air,
and shakes the earth, and makes a mighty **ROAR**.

Armstrong, Collins, Aldrin ride the fire and thunder pressed deep in their seats,
their bodies as heavy as clay. The rocket below them sheds parts as it soars. Bolts
explode, engines ignite - first stage, second stage, escape tower - gone. The
rocket flies lighter, the rocket flies faster; in twelve minutes' time, it's one
hundred miles high. Then, after an orbit around the Earth to talk with Mission
Control, to check the course, to check the rocket and ships, the rocket's last
stage fires again, pushing the astronauts on.

And when the Earth has rolled beneath and rolled behind and let the astronauts go,
the Saturn's last stage opens wide and releases *Columbia*, which was the rocket's
tip, and also *Eagle*, hidden till now, a stranger ship, more bug than bird, a
black and gold and folded spider. Michael Collins, Columbia's pilot, turns her back
around.

... and locks *Columbia* to *Eagle*. Then Armstrong, Collins, Aldrin leave the
last of the Saturn and travel on in their two small ships, joined together, flown
as one. They go rushing into darkness, flying toward the Moon, far away, cold and quite,
no air, no life, but glowing in the sky.

onboard columbia and eagle, armstrong, collins, aldrin unclick gloves, unclick
helmets, unclick the straps that hold them down, and float inside their small ships,
their home for a week.

Here there is no up or down; an astronaut can spin in air and turn a floor into
a wall or a ceiling to a floor. Here, on those sometimes ceilings, walls, and
floors - everywhere - there are straps and screens and gauges, buttons, handles,
hoses, and switches, switches, switches.

There are food and clothes packed into corners. There are flight plans, flashlights,
pens, and cameras - and they float too.
They drift from hands and pockets. That's why there's Velcro everywhere: for
holding things so they stay put.

Here, where everything floats, it takes some skill to eat a meal. That ham salad
sandwich? Watch the crumbs! Soup? It comes in a bag, dry as dust. Fix the bag to
the water gun, fill it, mix it, stir it up. Cream of chicken - not too bad! (Better
than the peanut cubes.)

Here, where everything floats, it takes some skill to go to sleep. There are no
beds or pillows, no night or day. There is always, though, the hum of circuits,
the whir of machines, the thought of where you are, and the thought of where you
are going.

And one more thing. Here, where everything floats - everything - it takes some
skill to use the toilet. (It takes pipes and hoses and bags.) And there's no fresh
air outside the window; after a week this small home will not smell so good. This
is not why anyone wants to be an astronaut.

But still ahead there is the Moon, cold and quite, no air, no life, but glowing
in the sky. Glowing and growing, it takes them in, it pulls them close.

At the moon, collins stays in columbia, high above, a single circling soul.
Armstrong and Aldrin leave in *Eagle*, and take it low and lower. They have just
enough time and just enough fuel. They have a plan and a place to land, a chosen
safe site among the craters.

Now friends and strangers in the distance, down below, stay up late, get up early,
and stop as one to watch and wait. There are only maps and models to see; there
is no camera that can show the landing far away.

But what strange sounds there are to hear! Whistles, beeps, and static, strange
new words and quick, clipped news of altitudes and speeds, leaping across the
dark between Mission Control and the men who are taking the *Eagle* to land on
the Moon, who are going where no one has been.

Onboard *Eagle*, Aldrin calls out information while Armstrong steers the ship.
They fly low and lower, looking, looking for their landing site.
But now *Eagle*, they see, has flown too far. Tey are miles from where thy mean
to be, and below their small and spindly ship they see no level place, only broken
stone and rock, only shadows in deep craters on the great and growing Moon.
Far from home and far from help, still steady, steady, the astronauts fly till
time and fuel are running out.

Then ... there! Clean and flat, not too far! Sixty seconds left! Armstrong fires
the rockets. *Eagle* slows and lower goes until a spray of dust, a bloom of moon,
flowers up around her. Slow and slower, low and lower, low and lower - landing.

And far away, where friends and strangers lean to listen, where friends and
strangers lean to hear, there comes a distant voice: Armstrong, calling from the
Moon, calm as a man who just parked a car. "Houston," he says. "Tranquility Base
here. The *Eagle* has landed." Armstrong is calm - but on Earth they cheer!
Then Armstrong and Aldrin climb down from the *Eagle* in heavy gloves, in large,
round helmets, in suits not made for Earth - in suits made for the Moon, here
below, all around them, cold and quiet, no air, but life - there is life on the
strange and silent, magnificent Moon.
Armstrong and Aldrin walk its rough, wide places. They step, they hop, as light
as boys, they lope, they leap!
