# War with North Korea

* 2017/07/28, NK's missile was able to hit LA. The man behind it cares nothing
  for human life.
* Even worse is a nuke war, consequence destruction of the regime, SK, the death of millions
  of life. Confrontation between US and CHN.
* military actions risk a ruinous escalation. US doesn't have good intelligence
  on NK, bombs are hidden.
* Diplomacy is useless too. Clinton failed once.
* The only remaining option is to deter and contain. It's possible coz Kim cares
  about his own skin, and enjoys his life and power. Ways to deter:
    * reaffirm a nuke attack will be matched immediately
    * economic sanctions against NK, CHN companies which trade with NK
    * extend nuke guarantee to JPN, SK, protect them
    * guarantee CHN, US troops won't be on border
    * persuade CHN, it's better off to have a united/prosperous neighbor.

# China's conscience

* His dignified, calm and persistent calls for freedom for China's people
  made him one of the giants of moral dissent, who belongs with Andrei Sakharov
  and Nelson Mandela.
* Liu is dying of liver cancer. His crime was to write a petition calling for
  democracy. The CHN refused treatment abroad, posted guards, rub out sympathy
  expression on Internet. CHN wants the world to forget what he stood for, and
  It can happen.
* Western world is timid and cynical in response to CHN treatment of dissidents.
* Attitude of western world changed after 1989. CHN also release someone from time
  to time.
* 90 CHN economy booming and 2008 crisis, no body wants to annoy the rich China.
* China retaliates coutries who criticize its human-rights record, like Norway.
* Mr Xi give ratched up pressure on dissidents and use new AI tech to monitor them.

# North Korea's Missiles: Testing, testing ...

* NK 7/4 one range of 7.5k km, 7/28 one 10k km. Developing speed, Trump never expects
  the capacity.
* Too soon to confirm NK has ICBM, warhead needs compact and light.
* Current yield is 20 kton, these year might have 300 kton, which is H-bomb.
* There is skepticism about NK have the re-entry vehicle.
* A recent estimate NK will have ICBM in 2018.
* 以上是第一层意思，北韩导弹进展。
* reaction:
    * B1 bombers fly to SK
    * Antimissile in Alaska
    * Trump complained CHN, they make money from us, but they only do talk.
* Rex made more emollient comments: we want to talk.
* SK president wants greater military readiness but still want to talk
* The reaction is vague because no good options.
    * Construction talk, improbable
    * sanction, feeble
    * military actions, terrifying
* 第二层意思，各方反应。
* Some worries a war between NK and US.
* Some warns US's ability to deal with NK's nuclear. War is easy to escalate but
  hard to stop.
* Some is pessimistic about the war.
* 第三层意思，对战争的担忧。
