* Emperor Constantine



* Emperor Julian

这一段和《唐诗杂论》里写杜甫异曲同工：

The retired scholastic education of Julian, in which he had been more conversant
with books than with arms, with the dead than with with living, left him in
profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and government ... Yet even this
speculative philosophy, which men of business are too apt to despice, had filled
the mind of Julian with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples; had
animated him with the love of virtue, the desire of fame, and the contempt of
death.



这一段和《孙子吴起列传》异曲同工：

The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep. Rejecting
with disdain the delicacies provided for his table, he satisfied his appetite with
the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers. During
the rigor of a Gallic winter, he never suffered a fire in his bed-chamber ...

起之为将，与士卒最下者同衣食。卧不设席，行不骑乘，亲裹赢粮，与士卒分劳苦。卒有病疽者，起为吮之。
卒母闻而哭之。人曰：“子卒也，而将军自吮其疽，何哭为？”母曰：“非然也。往年吴公吮其父，其父战不旋踵，
遂死于敌。吴公今又吮其子，妾不知其死所矣。是以哭之。”
