## Breaking the bank

1. Money circuits first occurred in Mesopotamia.
2. Problems:
    1. wealth concentration.
    2. without sufficient understanding risks.
3. Work well as long as we understand inherited risk while suppressing undesirable
  wealth concentration.
4. Modern financial system are too complex but tech advantage (big data)
  makes it possible to understand outcome better, this can make economy security
  better or worse.

### How digital currencies work

1. invention of distributed ledger: block chains are consensually updated by
  a variety of proving mechanism.
2. enable analyze and monitor and understand money circuit.
3. Anyone can join, without central authority, one to one transaction, which are
  recorded publicly.

### The limitation of bitcoin

1. logistic limitation
    1. 7 transactions / sec V.S. visa 2000 / sec
    2. Adding new transactions to block chain is very energy hungry,
      ebay + Facebook + Google.
    3. a small number groups can control whole system.

### Good parts about tradecoin

1. back up a large liquid currency trustworthy.
2. Safer, cheaper to do international trade.
3. Geographically and politically diverse, immunity from the risk of default.
4. Oversight is still necessary, results can be simulated.

## The toxic well of loneliness

* Loneliness causes depression, cognitive decline and heart problems and stroke.
* Social isolation: falling marriage rate, fewer children, etc.

### What is it?

* People's feeling depends on situations. But some are chronically lonely.
* They are more likely to be hyper-vigilance to threats, depression and social
  withdrawal.
* Social isolation and loneliness are not the same.
* De Jong scale doesn't measure duration; UCLA scale doesn't delve into
  the feelings.

## Evolve to Exercise

### Food for thought

* Food changes the way of our living. Eating meat means more travel,
  and often coupled with increased cognitive sophistication.
* Hunting-and-gathering makes people more tightly knit, requires more sharing
  and cooperation.
* Put an evolutionary premium (value sth more important) on intelligence.
    * Technology creativity and innovation.
    * Social intelligence would have proved invaluable, as coordination and
      communication became ingrained parts of hominin strategy.
        * 举个例子：～300K years ago, hominin cognition had blossomed into the
          kind of sophistication seen in modern humans, with red and black
          pigments for visual expression and long-distance trade networks
          for premium stone tool material.
* Hunter-gathers are remarkably active, e.g. 15k one day. Run prey to exhaustion.
* The steady increase in brain size and technological complexity over the past
  2 million years seem to accumulate like snowballs rolling downhill, yet any
  impression of momentum is an illusion. Evolution has great memory but no plans.
  We are not inevitable. 正好和灭霸说得相反。
    * 举个例子：homo naledi 就没有再进化。

### Sharks on Savana

* No traits evolves in isolation: brains must fit snuggly inside their skulls,
  teeth inside their jaws; muscles, nerves and bones must function harmoniously.
  When a behavior strategy becomes norm, our physiology adapts to accommodate to
  and even depend on it. 第一段，总领，我们的生理机能会去适应我们的行为方式。
* 有些啮齿动物或肉食动物进化出了自己合成维生素的功能。我们的灵长类祖先开始出大量水果，所以这个
  功能就退化了。
