In the previous lesson, we discussed the agriculture revolution and the impact
it had upon humans, upon plants, upon animals. We saw at least in the case of
humans and animals, the agriculture revolution was quite a paradoxical process,
because from evolutionary perspective, it was a huge success, leading to the most
multiplication and spread of humans and farm animals all over the world. Whereas
12,000 years ago, there are perhaps 7M humans in the world and there are about
same number of cattle. Today there are 7B humans in the world and about 1.5B
cattle. But from the perspective of the individual out of the species, the
agriculture revolution was pretty bad news. Individual peasants in most period of
history lived harder lives than their great grand parents, the foragers. The individual
cows and bulls felt even worse. They are probably among the most miserable animals
ever to exist.

The collective evolutionary success is coupled, as we saw in previous lesson, with
a lot individual sufferings. In this lesson we will look more closely, the impact
of the agriculture revolution on humans and on the society that they created. The
most import impact, was the appearance of far more complex human societies than
ever before. Foragers lived in small band of a few dozen individuals which sometimes
belong to tribes of several hundreds or even thousands of people. In contrast,
farmers live their lives in villages and towns of hundreds or even thousands of people,
and with time, they established large cities, kingdoms and empires in which millions
of people cooperated on a daily basis towards common goals.

2:24
One reason for the growth of these big and complex human societies, was that
agriculture produced far more food per given territory than hunting and gathering
, and area which could support maybe 100 foragers by hunting and gathering, could
support 10,000 people by agriculture. Yet this growth in the amount of food is
only part of the story. In order to build large cities, kingdoms and empires, more
food is of course a necessary condition, but it's not a sufficient condition. The
mere fact that you can feed 10,000 people in the same town, or 1M people in the
same kingdom, does not guarantee that they can agree how to divide the food, how
to divide the land and water, how to settle disputes and conflicts and how to act
in times of crisis, like drought or war.

3:34
And if people cannot reach agreement about such things, then conflict spreads,
even if the storehouses and granaries are full of food. For example, it was not
food shortages that caused the most of the big wars and revolutions in history.
The French Revolution, contrary to common images, was led, not by famish peasants,
but by fat lawyers. They were the ones who led the revolution. Similarly, the two
world wars, say world war I and world war II, they did not begin due to a shortage
of food.
