In the previous lesson, we discussed the agriculture revolution and the impact
it had upon humans, upon plants, upon animals. We saw at least in the case of
humans and animals, the agriculture revolution was quite a paradoxical process,
because from evolutionary perspective, it was a huge success, leading to the most
multiplication and spread of humans and farm animals all over the world. Whereas
12,000 years ago, there are perhaps 7M humans in the world and there are about
same number of cattle. Today there are 7B humans in the world and about 1.5B
cattle. But from the perspective of the individual out of the species, the
agriculture revolution was pretty bad news. Individual peasants in most period of
history lived harder lives than their great grand parents, the foragers. The individual
cows and bulls felt even worse. They are probably among the most miserable animals
ever to exist.

The collective evolutionary success is coupled, as we saw in previous lesson, with
a lot individual sufferings. In this lesson we will look more closely, the impact
of the agriculture revolution on humans and on the society that they created. The
most import impact, was the appearance of far more complex human societies than
ever before. Foragers lived in small band of a few dozen individuals which sometimes
belong to tribes of several hundreds or even thousands of people. In contrast,
farmers live their lives in villages and towns of hundreds or even thousands of people,
and with time, they established large cities, kingdoms and empires in which millions
of people cooperated on a daily basis towards common goals.
